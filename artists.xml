					<artistBio><![CDATA[American jazz keyboardist Adam Holzman (born 15 February 1958, New York City) has played with a wide variety of notable performers and bands - often working as their producer and arranger at the same time.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Being the son of Elektra Records&#39; founder (Jac Holzman) Adam Holzman was introduced to the music industry early on. His skilled mastering of the piano led to a recording gig with Miles Davis for his 1985 &#39;Tutu&#39; album. Holzman stayed with Davis for four years, eventually becoming his musical director. In the early 1990s, he founded the band Mona Lisa Overdrive, which subsequently changed its name to Brave New World due to copyright issues. In his carrier as a recording and touring musician Holzman has worked with Robben Ford, Marcus Miller and Ray Wilson, just to mention a few. In the last couple of years Adam Holzman has toured with prog rock sensation Steven Wilson.

That&#39;s all fine and well, but what is a keyboard player doing on TC Electronic&#39;s page, you ask?

Well, whenever something really great and versatile is made, there&#39;s virtually no limit for its uses. The Fender Bassman amp was (as the name suggests) a Bass amp only, but guitarists found that it cranked up even nicer when fed with an electric guitar. Similarly, Leslie-cabinets were originally the Hammond-player choice only, but Hendrix, Clapton and other guitar geniuses changed that throughout the 1960s. In the same way, keyboard players have also taken guitar-centric technology and made it theirs. Ever since the release of TC Electronic&#39;s legendary Stereo Chorus Flanger, Rhodes-players have used the pedal to give an edge to their playing.
Adam Holzman has an extensive collection of guitar pedals. Among the crowd you will find the Hall Of Fame and the Flashback Delay.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Al Schmitt is a renowned recording engineer who started his recording career in New York City. During the past several decades, he has worked with such artists as Paul McCartney, Gloria Estefan, George Benson, Toto, Steely Dan, Ray Charles, Norah Jones and many more.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[He began working at the Apex Recording Studios at the age of 19 and later moved to Los Angeles, where he became a staff engineer at the landmark Radio Recorders, Hollywood. In the early 1960s, he moved to RCA Studios in Hollywood as a staff engineer, where he worked on albums for Henry Mancini, Cal Tjader, Al Hirt, Rosemary Clooney, Liverpool Five, The Astronauts and Sam Cooke. He also handled a number of motion-picture scoring dates for composers Alex North and Elmer Bernstein.
 

In 1966, Schmitt left RCA and became an independent producer, working on albums for Jefferson Airplane, Eddie Fisher, Glenn Yarborough, Jackson Browne and Neil Young; in the mid-70s, he began spending more time engineering again, recording and mixing. Other career highlights include engineering Frank Sinatra&#39;s Duets albums, Ray Charles&#39; Genius Loves Company and several of Diana Krall&#39;s successful albums. Much of his work in the last few years has been with acclaimed producer Tommy LiPuma.
 

Al has recorded and mixed more than 150 Gold and Platinum albums. He was inducted into the TEC Awards Hall of Fame in 1997, and in 2006 he received the Grammy Trustees Lifetime Achievement Award. Al has won a total of 18 Grammy Awards - more than any other engineer or mixer. In addition, he was awarded two Latin Grammy Awards in 2000, including Album of the Year. In 2005, he won five Grammys for his work on Ray Charles&#39; Genius Loves Company, including Album of the Year; with that award he set the record of most Grammys won by an engineer or mixer in one night. He is also the only person to win both the Grammy and Latin Grammy for Album of the Year.
 

The System 6000 is always part of Al&#39;s productions, whether he is working as a producer or recording engineer: &#39;It&#39;s a tool I use every day. It&#39;s such a natural sounding unit, and the control you have over everything is just great. I just love [the 6000] and it&#39;s one of the first things I set up when I&#39;m mixing,&#39; Schmitt says.
 

Schmitt also uses the System 6000 for monitoring-reverb when he&#39;s tracking - he sets it up so that he can simulate what it will sound like when he&#39;s mixing. &#39;I will rather have everything dry so I can change it later on,&#39; he explains. &#39;If I just print it, I&#39;m stuck with it, so I try not to do that.&#39;
 

Whenever Al Schmitt travels to work around the world, he will either take his System 6000 with him or make sure that they have one wherever he&#39;s going. &quot;The fact that the 6000 gives me the opportunity to match up rooms anywhere I go is a great tool. Whether I&#39;m in London at AIR or Abbey Road Studio, or here in the LA at Capital, or Criteria in Miami, I have great control over the sound. This way, I can get an idea of how it is going sound when I get down to mixing.&#39;

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Grammy Award winner, musical talent and in some regions the most-demanded session guitarist around, Albert Lee is nothing less than world renowned. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[The variation and diversity of the musical types Albert brings to the table is jaw-dropping. In the 60&#39;s he was a top R&amp;B guitarist and the 70&#39;s saw him as a top rockability guitarist with an immense aptitude for country music.

Having a musical father, who played an accordion and a piano, Albert was introduced to music from the early age. He, as a kid, first started playing the piano, but found the guitar to be much more intriguing and switched instruments.

At the age of 16, he became a real musical professional and joined the at that time best R&amp;B band on English scene, the Thunderbirds. But after 4 years of being with the Thunderbirds, Albert found himself bored and left the band.

The next two years for Albert Lee were just passing by through several musical projects and names like Skeeter Davis, Bobby Bare and George Hamilton IV, as well as several bands and groups like Country Fever and Poet &amp; the One man Band (a very popular live band in the UK).

His reputation grew and session work blossomed as he was invited to join Jerry Lee Lewis&#39;s The London Sessions, which opened the door for reunion with 60&#39;s American acts. This eventually led to the permanent position in the Crickets. The band cut three albums. 

Lee received numerous offers for session work and in the mid 70&#39;s Lee joined Joe Cocker&#39;s Band for his album Stingray. This ultimately led to a solo album with A&amp;M records that at the time were Cocker&#39;s label.
During the time Lee signed his first solo album he was also touring and recording a gig with Emmylou Harris&#39;s Hot Band, that led Lee to postponing the release of his own album. He ended touring with the Hot Band to finish his solo album and in 1979 Hiding was released to the public. 

Being a highly demanded musician, Lee scored a high-profile gig, which led to a five-year adventure with Eric Clapton&#39;s band. Albert did not abandon his own solo career and continuously released several albums including his self-titled Albert Lee and instrumental releases on MCA, namely Speechless and Gagged But Not Bound.
From 1983 until 20 years after Albert Lee was a guitarist and Musical Director for now retired band Everly Brothers.

Repeatedly voted &#39;Best Country Guitarist&#39; in the Guitar Player magazine Readers&#39;  Choice Awards, Albert is a member of the Guitar Player  Gallery of Greats, an exclusive membership designated only to those who win the prestigious award five times.

Recently Albert has appeared at three of Eric Clapton&#39;s highly acclaimed &quot;Crossroads&quot; benefit concerts and was also featured in the Concert for George  live performance and film  in 2002. Currently working with Hogan&#39;s Heroes and Bill Wyman&#39;s Rhythm Kings, Lee will soon be celebrating  his 70th birthday - and 53 years on the road - with a number of special concerts, both in the UK and US.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Rock and roll, hard rock, punk rock and metal are all genres that the Danish rock band, Volbeat, master. The band toured with legendary Metallica in 2010 and is a force to be reckoned with live. We had a chat with bassist Anders Kj&#248;lholm from Volbeat to hear his view on our bass gear.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Volbeat was formed in Copenhagen in 2001, and comprises of vocalist and guitarist Michael Poulsen, guitarist Thomas Bredahl, bassist Anders Kj&#248;lholm and drummer Jon Larsen. Volbeat has released four studio albums and one live DVD, that are all chart toppers and/or certiﬁed gold in Europe, with their seminal release &quot;Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil&quot; certiﬁed Platinum. 

Steadily increasing their fan base with their unique style of music and uncompromising stage shows, Volbeat continues to marry Heavy Metal and Rockabilly, smear it with a kiss of crunchy guitars, before driving away in a vintage Cadillac stuffed with Marshall plexis and ﬁlled with leaded gas.

We caught up with Volbeat&#39;s bass player Anders Kj&#248;lholm, who has been part of Volbeat since day one, to hear his view on our gear he uses on- and off stage (watch video on the left). Though Volbeat was formed in 2001, Anders&#39; passion for playing music is not a new thing:

Anders:It started in school when I was about 10 years old. I saw the drum kit in my school&#39;s music room, so it started out with me wanting to play drums. That is how it started. Then my friend formed a band, but his friend was playing the drums already and he was on the guitar, so I was left with the only instrument in the room, the bass. After a while the bass was my best friend, and I&#39;ve been playing bass ever since.

TC: Which TC products are you using?

Anders:I am using the RH450 bass amp, the RS410 cabs and the Polytone tuner.

TC: How did you hear about the gear in the first place and what attracted you to it?

Anders:My tech had heard about it, so we tried it out and it sounded really good, so I went for it. It&#39;s small and light but very powerful and with a great tone. I use it both for live gigs and in the studio&#39;, Anders says regarding the daily use of the units. &#39;It hasn&#39;t really changed the way I work or play, but the 4 channel switch is a good feature, as I don&#39;t have to dial on the amp, and I can just switch to another channel to bring up more low end or tone if needed&#39;.

Anytime Volbeat enters the studio or steps on to the stage, Anders knows exactly what he can expect from his TC Electronics gear when it comes to reliability and sound, which of course lets him focus on the performance at hand, instead of constant tweaking and worrying: &#39;I just plug in and play, not much else to do. I don&#39;t compose or write the music and the recording is straight forward. 

Finally, we asked Anders about his plans for the future in the ever-busy Volbeat, which he summed up quite neatly: &#39;Playing the bass to the day I die!&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Andr&#233;s Mayo is a leading, Grammy-awarded audio engineer and producer based in Argentina. The one project Andr&#233;s is most proud of is an impressive 7-DVD Tango collection that won 2 Grammy Awards and is delivered in a custom-made bandoneon box.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[This collection has been used as an official gift for VIP visitors such as Sir Paul McCartney and the former presidents of China, Armenia, Chile and Brazil.

Andr&#233;s is a long-time System 6000 User and his favorite algorithm is the De-esser, which he uses as a dynamic EQ in his mastering sessions. &#39;I understand mastering as a surgery, where you need to remove energy excess in certain areas with extreme precision, rather than adding low end, hi end or gain. When you detect the compromising frequency ranges, which are usually quite narrow, you need a high-precision tool to work in that area. The De-esser of System 6000 is exactly what I need for accomplishing this, and I use it extensively in different areas of the audio spectrum, even in the 100 Hz range with great success,&#39; says Andr&#233;s Mayo.

Asked for a single advice for upcoming mastering engineers, Andr&#233;s points out the obvious. Train your ears! Andr&#233;s does it every single day, and he adds that blind listening is the key to avoid being fooled by the many potential factors of dispersion. In other words, if your ears are responding, no spectrum analyzer will do a better job.

When Andr&#233;s entered the pro audio industry more than 20 years ago, it was in a period of transition as digital was the new black, yet he had to learn how to master the analog techniques such as splicing tape and cutting vinyl. Therefore, Andr&#233;s picked up the best from both worlds as he has always been keen on learning as much as possible about new fields of technology that caught his interest. Interactive platforms became such a field and with the introduction of the DVD in the late 90s, Andr&#233;s read every book published on the subject to learn all aspects of this new format. He then founded TangoDVD (www.tangodvd.com) which is a company entirely devoted to the production of musical titles on DVD.

Later BluRay was introduced and history repeated itself, so today Andr&#233;s can provide any solution to his clients, including dedicated mixing and mastering for vinyl as well as 5.1 or 7.1 delivery for DVD or BluRay, or complying to the new iTunes standard. His facility was the first in Latin America to produce MFiT masters (Mastered For iTunes).

In the video below (English and Spanish versions), Andres shows us how he uses his System 6000 in his mastering studio and demos how he applies the De-esser for treating a live vocal track.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Andrew Levy is one of those people in the music industry that seem to have infinite amounts of creativity. Best know (and most comfy) as the bass player for The Brand New Heavies, Andrew is also a proficient songwriter, keyboard player and producer.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[The Brand New Heavies began in the 1980s as group called Brother International. The founding and ever-present trio of Jan Kincaid (drums), Simon Bartholomew (guitar) and Andrew Levy (bass/keyboard) had been influential in creating what became known as the acid jazz scene. They have since steered the Brand New Heavies into the current millennium, where they remain as influential and respected as ever.

The Heavies first made their reputation on the 80s London club circuit and were standard-bearers for acid jazz, the slower-paced, more soulful counterpart of acid house that also spawned the likes of Jamiroquai and Galliano. 
They got their biggest breakthrough following an article in Vanity Fair in August 1991. Not only is it a major magazine, but also to their luck, it was the issue that featured filmstar Demi Moore posing naked and pregnant on the front cover - approximately 100 million people saw the magazine. Anyone, who looked beyond the front cover and started flipping through the pages, would have seen the feature headlined &#39;Funky and Chic&#39; about up-and-coming British band called The Brand New Heavies. They were far from newborn at the time, having been conceived in the London suburb of Ealing in 1985 - but they were about to deliver the world some unique music. After that, they started getting press attention and the word got back to the UK and suddenly, there was this massive buzz … From then on, the public and press perception really took off for The Brand New Heavies.

Their eponymous debut album, now re-issued with new singer N&#39;Dea Davenport&#39;s vocals added, took off around the world in 1992, fuelled by the hits &#39;Never Stop&#39;, &#39;Stay This Way&#39; and &#39;Dream Come True&#39;. The video for &#39;Stay This Way&#39; enjoyed heavy rotation on MTV, taking them to a still wider audience.
Davenport&#39;s departed the band again in 1994 and was replaced by Siedah Garrett who joined the group for their next album, Shelter, released in 1997. It contained the minor hit, the Carole King-penned song &quot;You&#39;ve Got a Friend&quot; that was originally made famous by James Taylor. 
But old-school fans dreamed of a reunion with N&#39;Dea Davenport and in 2006, their wish was granted. The group re-emerged in fine style with a new CD called Get Used To It, including a fabulous version of Stevie Wonder&#39;s I Don&#39;t Know Why (I Love You).

Andrew made us two amazing TonePrints for the Flashback delay and Vortex Flanger. They are both used live and in The Brand New Heavies&#39; brand new studio where they recorded their latest album.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[As a young teenager, Andy Narsingh was introduced to music by his father&#39;s 6 string guitar which he grew to love playing.  As he approached 16, he tried playing the bass guitar, jamming out to Rush &#39;The Spirit of Radio&#39;, where he found his ultimate calling in life.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[With such huge influences as Geddy Lee, Stu Hamm and Billy Sheehan to guide him, Andy&#39;s progressive rock/funk style started to take shape and the rest is history. Andy formed his first progressive rock band in 1998 and called the band ARSIN.  This was a 3 piece all original band that released their EP in 2000 called &#39;The Outside&#39; which was also released in Europe/Japan under the band name HEAVENS FIRE.  On the day of the release, the band was not celebrating the worldwide debut, instead, they were paying their final respects to their drummer, Michael (MicMac) MacKinnon, who lost his life in a house fire a few days earlier.  Devastated, the members cancelled their upcoming tour to support the EP in Europe and Japan, and took some much needed time to recoup their energies.  This would find the guys at the end of an era.  The band ARSIN did not reform or record again.

Instead, Andy took time away from the music industry and enrolled in Film School.  He got involved in film production and sound tracks.  It took almost 7 years before Andy was able to admit that he needed to play his bass guitar again, and without any hesitation, started playing again.  

As 2012 was on its way to year end, Andy was approached to record on the Loa House &#39;VooDoo Love&#39; CD.  A dark tale of voodoo influences and killing for love storylines, the band released their CD on January 26, 2013.  Without any solid bookings to play the CD to live audiences, Andy grew restless again and Hooked Up with JT Harris once again to reform HEAVENS FIRE band lineup, than adding long time friend Darren James Smith of &#39;Jake E Lees Red Dragon Cartel &#39; to handle vocals and lyric writing .  They recorded a full CD worth of original songs and released &#39;Judgement Day&#39; on June 17, 2013.  &#39;Judgement Day&#39; has been getting major airplay in Europe on various Rock / Metal web stations through the summer months.  Heavens Fire has also opened several shows co-billed with Harem Scarem over recent months.

Andy has also been keeping his chops up by jamming with some of the best known and respected musicians in Toronto.  He landed a recording deal with his long time hero&#39;s Moxy.  He keeps up his funk influences playing with the Boogiemen and is keeping his reformation of ARSIN on his TO DO list.  Andy will be the lead vocalist in the newly formed power trio ARSIN.  

Andy Narsingh plays the following: FBass Custom Handmade Basses, Fender Precision Basses, Taurus 3 pedals and TC Electronic Bass Systems.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[With his virtuoso guitar playing, iconic riffs, and unique take on guitar tone, Andy Summers has solidified his place amongst the biggest guitarists in the history of rock… and rightfully so! ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Andy Summers currently uses a vast array of TC effects. Especially the Flashback Delay, Vortex Flanger and Hall of Fame Reverb lets Andy achieve tones harking back to the days of The Police, whilst containing the modern sonic flexibility that keeps pushing his songwriting into exciting new territories.

The English multi-instrumentalist and composer Andrew James &quot;Andy&quot; Summers was born in Lancashire in 1942. In his early youth he took piano lessons, but decided to pick up the guitar in 1956 inspired by the strong musical current of the time. 

At the age of sixteen he was playing the local clubs, and from his early 20s on he played with London based rhythm and blues bands such as Zoot Money&#39;s Big Roll Band, The Soft Machine and (for a brief time in 1968) The Animals.

After studying for five years at the California State University Northridge in the early 1970s, Summers returned to London. 

In 1977 he joined The Police replacing original guitarist Henri Padovani. The Police quickly rose to fame, due to the ingenious synthesis of Stewart Copeland&#39;s reggae rhythms, Andy Summers&#39; splashing guitar riffs and Sting&#39;s distinct vocal.

As a member of the trio Andy Summers created some of the most seminal guitar riffs of all time, which helped define a whole new take on rock music. Some of his most acclaimed playing can be heard on songs like &#39;Message in a bottle&#39;, &#39;Roxanne&#39;, &#39;Walking on the moon&#39;, &#39;Don&#39;t stand so close to me&#39; and &#39;Every breath you take&#39;.

In 1984, after seven years of touring and record sales around eighty million, The Police split up. During his time with The Police Andy won two Grammys for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. He was also voted the number one pop guitarist for five years by Guitar Player Magazine and was inducted into the Guitar Player Hall of Fame. In 2003, Andy&#39;s former bandmates, Sting, and Stewart followed suit, as The Police got inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 

Since The Police broke up in 1984 Andy has been very productive, releasing no less than fourteen solo albums: &#39;XYZ&#39; (1986), &#39;Mysterious Barricades&#39; (1988), &#39;The Golden Wire&#39; (1989), &#39;Charming Snakes&#39; (1990), &#39;World Gone Strange&#39; (1991), &#39;Synaethesia&#39; (1996), &#39;The Last Dance of Mr. X&#39; (1997), &#39;A Windham Hill Retrospective&#39; (1998), &#39;Green Chimneys&#39; (1999), &#39;Peggy&#39;s Blue Skylight&#39; (2000), &#39;Earth + Sky&#39; (2004), &#39;The X Tracks&#39; (2005), &quot;Metal Dog&quot; (2015), and &quot;Triboluminescence&quot; (2017).

In 2007 The Police reunited for a brief period, embarking on what would become the third highest grossing tour of all time - a true testament to the impact of the group&#39;s music.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[ANDY WOOD is recognized as part of the forefront of this generation&#39;s top influential guitarists.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Currently touring as the guitarist and mandolinist for country super group, RASCAL FLATTS, Andy is also performing live with his own band promoting CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TRUTH AND A LIE, the new double album which showcases Andy&#39;s vast musical influences and abilities.

Looking for an outlet for styles other than hard rock, Andy also released his debut solo album A DISCONCERTING AMALGAM. This instrumental record covers a broad range of genres including fusion, rock, metal, and acoustic bluegrass. Andy Wood is known for blurring the lines of preconceived genres. Andy has toured as a guitarist for various acts, including Rascal Flatts (current) Sebastian Bach, Disciple, and Scott Stapp.

Andy spent most of his childhood playing and competing in bluegrass festivals. Touring the bluegrass circuit with his cousin and grandfather provided Andy with the necessary exposure that helped refine and sharpen his skills. Andy and his cousin held various state championship titles. At the young age of sixteen Andy finished second in the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MANDOLIN CONTEST in Winfield, Kansas. All of this was accomplished before Andy discovered the world of electric guitar at the age of eighteen.
Fast-forward a few years. Andy&#39;s curiosity and appreciation for music drew him into the world of electric guitars. The new instrument was familiar due to his experience with acoustic instruments, but at the same time, allowed him to manipulate his sound in ways never before possible. He began studying the styles of Nashville session players such as Brent Mason and Albert Lee.
It was not long after Andy had immersed himself in new styles such as jazz, swing, fusion, and rock. Andy began to study other guitar greats such as The Dixie Dregs, Eric Johnson, Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, and Steve Vai.  The young guitarist began incorporating their influences into his own style.
At the age of 22, Andy was drawn back to competition in the form of GUITARMAGGEDON, a guitar contest sponsored by Guitar Center. Andy was a face in the crowd of 3,400 other contestants, but he made his presence known by being crowned champion of this prestigious tournament.
Not long after winning Guitarmaggedon, Andy became a founding member of the rock group DOWN FROM UP. They have toured with Seven Dust, Drowning Pool and 10 Years.
As Andy climbs to greater and greater heights, his technical proficiency and tasteful chops makes Mr. Wood a force to be reckoned with, and a name you will not forget.  If you find yourself &#39;Caught Between The Truth and a Lie,&#39; you&#39;ll need all the &#39;Charisma&#39; you can get your hands on!]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Antony King is a sound engineer who has worked with some of the biggest artists you could ever think of, including Depeche Mode, Noel Gallagher, The Faces, The Cure, Amy Winehouse, Tom Jones and many others. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Antony found his passion for sound engineering while studying at the university. One gig led to another and he is currently on tour with the legendary band Depeche Mode as a live sound engineer.
Antony&#39;s touring rig holds several TC Electronic products: System 6000 for Reverb, D-Two for Delay and Konnekt 48 for tracking the live shows.
About his use of System 6000 Reverb Antony says: &#39;I haven&#39;t done a tour without one in a long time. I&#39;ve always had one in my rack, because its sounds are just fantastic.&#39; Antony uses this Reverb on all Depeche Mode songs, whether it&#39;s for live sounds or DVD production: &#39;This goes everywhere with me, there is just no other reverb for me.&#39;
Antony uses D-Two delay to enhance a couple of Depeche Mode songs like &#39;Halo&#39; and &#39;Should Be Higher&#39;.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Audley Freed has seen his career highlight playing and recording a bestselling live album with Jimmy Page. Over the years he has focused his time and energy as a respected session artist supporting the likes of Joe Perry and The Dixie Chicks. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Southern guitarist and songwriter, Audley Freed first gained recognition when he formed the band Cry Of Love in 1989, which was subsequently signed to Columbia Records. Their debut album &#39;Brother&#39; impressed everyone and spawned two No. 1 and two Top Ten AOR hits, including &#39;Peace Pipe&#39; that was named by Billboard as one of the &#39;top 50 AOR songs of all time&#39;. Following a second Columbia release in 1997, the band parted ways and Freed was free to join The Black Crowes on lead guitar.
During his 3-year spell with The Black Crowes, Freed managed to tour the U.S., Europe and Asia, whilst also lending his talent to the recording of the album &#39;Lions&#39;. Freed proclaims that his &#39;career highlight and life highlight&#39; came when he at the turn of the millennium, together with the rest of the Crowes, shared the stage with Led Zeppelin guitarist and rock icon Jimmy Page. This collaboration was immortalized into rock &amp; roll history through the recording of the double live album &#39;Jimmy Page &amp; The Black Crowes: Live at the Greek&#39; that went on to reach Gold certification.

As an active and routined session player in Nashville, Freed truly managed to thrill audiences with his versatile range on the guitar. His projects as a guitarist and songwriter have included recordings with Gov′t Mule, Alvin Youngblood Hart, Job Cain, New Earth Mud, Joe Perry and The Dixie Chicks. Freed also joined the Dixie Chicks for their &#39;Accidents and Accusations&#39; tour, then toured with Peter Frampton before joining Jakob Dylan′s band, the Gold Mountain Rebels, touring in support of Dylan′s solo album &#39;Seeing Things&#39;.

Freed&#39;s latest project has seen him reunite with Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman and other notable musicians to form the group Trigger Hippy. Audley Freed is another musician who has been recommended TC Electronic gear by a friend and has been impressed by its flexibility. &#39;When I plugged in the delay it sounded awesome! You can tweak it in a thousand ways&#39; he says, as he talks about the Flashback Delay. TC had the pleasure of meeting Audley Freed and creating two unique TonePrints: the Slap Back for the Flashback Delay and the Leslie for the Shaker Vibrato.  ]]></artistBio2>

Bass					</artistSegment>
					<artistBio><![CDATA[Ben Epstein has played in Duffy&#39;s band and toured the globe in support of the Welsh singer&#39;s debut album. Since then he has shared the stage with prominent artists such as Sophie Ellis Bextor, Marina And The Diamonds, Cheryl Cole, Mika, Will Young, Geri Halliwell, Gary Barlow and even Ronnie Wood.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[His current success on the bass could not have been predicted, especially as it wasn&#39;t even his primary instrument when he first started playing…

&#39;I started bass at about 12,&#39; he recalls. &#39;I&#39;d actually been playing classical and Spanish guitar since the age of six. I got an electric guitar but found that with the fingering techniques, it pushed you more towards bass. I had not been playing with a pick so it was a natural progression for me to go to bass. I still do a lot of guitar stuff but I don&#39;t really have the gear for playing guitar live so it&#39;s mostly recording; I end up getting the bass out most of the time. In fact it&#39;s turned into a bit of an obsession as I have loads of bass gear! If I started collecting guitar gear as well it would turn into a bit of a nightmare…&#39;

Despite having a lot of gear Ben is very reticent when it comes to endorsing any one product…

&#39;I always said I&#39;d never endorse anything unless it was really something that I genuinely believed in and really wanted,&#39; he says. &#39;I know of some players using gear which I think is crap but they use it as they got it for free. But I only use stuff that I like and that I&#39;d go out and buy anyway you know?&#39; 

Fortunately Ben has no such problem with TC Electronic&#39;s RH450, as he loves it, but it took some persuading to get him to try it out…

&#39;At the time RH450 came out I had everything I needed and didn&#39;t need a new amp,&#39; he says, &#39;but then a studio guy that I was working with said &#39;TC Electronic make really good stuff you know and you should check it out&#39;. I&#39;d never really heard much about it and only knew that they did reverb units and stuff like that. But then I thought I&#39;d give it a go. I ended up playing an RH450 in a shop in Tokyo and thought &#39;bloody hell, it&#39;s actually really good.&#39; &#39;

&#39;I&#39;ve since used the amp in some gigantic places,&#39; he continues, &#39;some huge festivals outdoors, but where it really comes in handy is on day to day stuff. That amp works in every room I&#39;ve been in. I just go in, bam: three different basses, three different presets. I hardly ever have to mess with it as it always sounds right and the tuner is bright and accurate.&#39;

&#39;I love the sound of it flat,&#39; he says, &#39;it gives you the true transparent sound of your bass and doesn&#39;t box up when you drive it hard.  Plus all the features are really usable; it seems like a lot of thought was put into the design of this amp. The gain and volume responds like a valve amp 4 times its size, I have never run out of headroom, even in really loud bands. Also, I can get the full rig in the boot of my car and don&#39;t have to break my back any more lifting those valve rigs.&#39;

&#39;There are not many features on this amp that I don&#39;t use.  I have the compressor cranked most of the time and I use a couple of the presets for different Tube Tone distortion settings; with a pick it sounds killer and it means I can often leave my pedals at home and just plug direct into the amp.
 

&#39;In 5 years of gigging and touring I have never had any problems with this amp. It&#39;s been rock solid reliable - I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough.&#39;

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Meet the man with fearless onstage aerobics and extraordinary musical arrangements, Ben Weinman, He combines intricate speed with depth of feeling on his guitar, garnering admiration from guitarists worldwide. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Ben Weinman really got into music in the 90s. Inspired by Soundgarden who has been a major influence in the way Weinman thinks and writes music, he was lead down the rabbithole of musical wonderment. 

While thrashing away on his guitar, Weinman attended Fairleigh Dickenson University in Madison and got himself a degree in psychology. Afterwards he studied Corporate Communications at FDU gaining knowledge on the business world. 

He is known for his outspoken views on the music industry and has spoken at universities and conferences on the subject of music production and the music business. 

In 1997 Weinman founded the mathcore band the Dillinger Escape Plan. The band emerged from the hardcore punk trio Arcane and became The Dillinger Escape Plan - a reference to John Dillinger, the famous 1930s bank robber who managed to escape jail multiple times. 

The only remaining original member is Ben Weinman who is involved in the production of all their releases as well as the management of the band. 

The band was renowned for their intense performances, which are increasingly wild and often violent. With elaborate performances as well as a creative and technical approach of their music the Dillinger Escape Plan has released five studio albums, been mentioned in mass media such as Rolling Stone magazine and New York Times, had Billboard chart status and performances on television such as Late Night with Conan O&#39;Brien.

In 2009 they started their own label Party Smasher and released their records through this. Even though there have been some replacements en route the Dillinger Escape Plan is often named one of the most important bands to have emerged over the last decade.  

Besides working with The Dillinger Escape Plan Weinman writes music for Giraffe Tounge Orchestra. Members of the super group are Brent Hinds (Mastodon), Jon Theodore (former The Mars Volta&#39;s drummer) and Eric Avery (former Jane&#39;s Addiction&#39;s bassist).  

Weinman has over the past decade evolved into one of the finest writers of epic, multilayered, catchy-as-all-get hard rock. He has been named one of the &quot;100 greatest guitarists of all time&quot; by SPIN magazine, &quot;50 fastest guitar player of all time&quot; and &quot;Top 25 cult guitarists&quot; by Guitar World. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[From the insane heaviness of March Of The Fireants, the evocative playing of Seabeast, the iconic intro to Blood And Thunder, all the way to the fuzzy goodness of their recent smash hit Curl Of The Burl, Mastodon guitarist Bill Kelliher and his bandmates have set the world of rock and metal ablaze.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Never afraid to experiment, explore, have fun and just plain rock, Bill&#39;s role in Mastodon centers around rhythm guitar, laying a foundation that is mindboggingly complex and super-tight, yet free to flow with the eclectic outbursts of brilliance of lead guitarist Brent Hinds and the insanely cool time-signature shifts of drummer Brann Dailor. Bill fulfills this task with excellence, churning out killer-riff after killer-riff like there is no tomorrow, with an originality, creativity and musicianship that&#39;s quite a sight to behold.

Along with the rest of Mastodon Kelliher has been on a steady rise since forming in early 2000. They have become known for taking on ambitious concepts on their albums Leviathan and Crack the Skye that have been based on Herman Melville&#39;s Moby Dick and on the idea of an out-of-body experience. 

In 2007 Kelliher and Brent Hinds won the Metal Hammer Golden Gods awards for best shredders. In 2011 music magazines Metal Hammer, Classic Rock and Rock Sound all voted Mastodon&#39;s album The Hunter as best record of the year. Furthermore, BBC stated about Mastodon: &#39;They are the most ambitious, most fearless, most fun heavy metal band to have breached the mainstream since the genre oozed its way out of the Midlands in the 1970s.&quot;
Kelliher has mentioned being a fan of harmonized, layered guitar parts, relating it to playing rhythm along to albums as a kid, where he learned to focus on locking in on the rhythm. Hinds tells that Kelliher uses a lot of time and effort on coming up with the driving rhythms that push the songs forwards. Kelliher saves most of his ideas for riffs, noting that when revisiting interesting riff ideas he&#39;ll often find the riffs not quite right, but that they often spawn new, more interesting ideas. We are thrilled that Bill Kelliher use the G-System and PolyTune Mini as part of his studio set-up and live equipment, helping him explore new musical ground.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Grammy-nominated producer, engineer, mixer and songwriter Bill Reynolds has built a formidable studio career while maintaining his role as bassist for Band of Horses.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Originally from Asheville, North Carolina, Reynolds left a full-ride scholarship to Appalachian State for classical bass performance to tour with the Sub Pop records band he co-founded, The Blue Rags. After two full-length albums and 5 years of touring, he built a recording studio in Asheville where he made records for the next 7 years while actively touring with various bands including Drugmoney and Donna the Buffalo. 

In 2007, while co-producing and engineering the Avett Brothers&#39; Emotionalism at Echo Mountain Studio, Reynolds met Band of Horses who were coming in to work on their album Cease to Begin. They quickly became friends and frontman Ben Bridwell asked Reynolds to join the band when they began touring in support of the record. In 2010, their album Infinite Arms was nominated for the Grammy award for Best Alternative Album. Reynolds contributed production, engineering, bass, and a co-write for the song &quot;Life on Earth,&quot; which was included on the Twilight: Breaking Dawn Soundtrack. Many more of his songs have found homes on hit TV shows including House, Justified and Army Wives. 

Working from Ojai, CA, Reynolds recently finished mixing albums for Truth and Salvage Co., Floating Action, Sea Stars, and is currently mixing forthcoming Band of Horses live material. Reynolds also recently finished co-writing and producing the song &quot;One, Two&quot; with Lissie for the new Harrison Ford film Paranoia, and in August 2013 he relocated to Nashvile into Jay Joyce&#39;s former studio.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Bobby Fernandez is a busy scoring mixer from Los Angeles who has worked on film with such prominent producers and directors as Clint Eastwood, Sam Raimi, Tim Burton, Alexander Payne and Peter Weir. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[The System 6000 has been his go-to reverb for over 13 years. The unit has been used on more than 200 films, including a number of large productions such as all of Clint Eastwood&#39;s films since 2002. Bobby&#39;s credits include soundtracks and music albums by Randy Newman, Danny Elfman, Charlie Parker, Michael Kamen, Marc Anthony and Pet Shop Boys. In 2004, he won the Grammy Award&#174; for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical - &#39;Genius Loves Company,&#39; performed by Ray Charles and various artists.

Bobby immediately fell in love with the System 6000 the first time he heard it. &#39;It was a reverb that I had been hoping that someone would come up with,&#39; he recalls. &#39;When I heard [the 6000] it was like actually being in a hall or a church. If you listen to the reverb tails, they are very natural and long without any regeneration. I immediately knew that this was a reverb I would have to have.

&#39;It does many, many things but, for me, the reverbs are the main thing that really drew me to the box. I use it in a 5.0 configuration, where I access the dual engine for both analog and digital 5.0, which is all I need. I use it in a 5.0 configuration because I would like to be able to bring up a reverb and emulate it being in the middle of a hall or a church.

&#39;There are a lot of other reverbs out there that do what the 6000 does, but not as well. A lot of them are stereo boxes, so you will need several of them to do what this does. I would much rather have just one box, open it up, call up a program, save all my presets, and not have to deal with a series of different boxes.&#39;

The scoring mixer uses the LFE channel, but not as a bass-management system to control low frequencies in his mix. Instead, he utilizes it as an effect separate from the 5.0 mix, where he assigns instruments that natively have a distinct low-end - such as synth pads or bass drums - to make them stand out.

Bobby has also used the popular Unwrap Algorithm with great results on several projects. &#39;It&#39;s a great option to have if you are opening up old recordings from stereo or even mono into 5.1,&#39; he says.

&#39;I can always count on [the TC 6000] - I can&#39;t think of mixing a film without it,&#39; he concludes.&#39; My only regret is that I don&#39;t have enough of them! If you haven&#39;t tried it, this is the box you need to use.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[While attending the Berklee College of Music, Whitford played in various different bands such as Cymbals of Resistance, Earth and Justin Thyme. But Brad Whitford is probably best known as the one of two guitarists for legendary classic rockers Aerosmith.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Replacing the original guitarist Ray Tabano, Brad Whitford joined Aerosmith in 1971 and Aerosmith went on to become one of the most successful bands of that time. Though, Whitford decided to leave the band in 1981 in favour of his own project Whitford/St. Holmes, which included singer Derek St. Holmes. However, they released only a single self-titled album before the project dissolved in 1981. Brad Whitford also briefly toured with former band-mate Joe Perry on The Joe Perry Project before once again joining up with the rest of the gang in Aerosmith in 1984.

While touring and performing with Aerosmith, Brad Whitford likes to keep it simple when it comes to effects and pedals. But, he does prefer the wide range of possibilities that TC effect pedals actually provide him. For example, he relies heavily on the Flashback Delay pedal that offers him such a wide variety of great echoes - and he especially digs the 2290 echo modulation. Also the TC Vortex Flanger holds a very special place on his board - a pedal that provides a nice thick flanger effect yet covers so much different grounds.

No doubt the products from TC hold a very special place in Brad&#39;s heart. As Brad&#39;s personal guitar tech Marco Moir puts it: &#39;So much TC gear is here because you can&#39;t do without!&#39;.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[The string-pickin&#39;, groovin&#39; and swingin&#39; phenomenon that is Brandon Gilliard is currently working as touring and session bassist for the Atlantic Records Recording Artist, Janelle Mon&#225;e.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[This fine gentleman has shared the stage with an incredible potpourri of world-known artists and groups, such as Avery Sunshine, Kimbra, David Crowder, Donnie McClurkin, Kirk Franklin, Tye Tribbett, Maceo Parker, Bob Carlisle, Jennifer Holliday, Ann Nesby, Archie Bell, Vicky Beeching, Daysahead, Juanita Bynum, Angie Stone, Bebe Winans, INOJ, Chionua, Hawk, Roman GianArthur, The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and many more.

Brandon began his musical journey at a very early age. He started playing alongside his father at the local church and soon found himself to be lured down the psychedelic pathway of music. As he grew older, he served as the drum major in his high school marching band and, to this day, holds the mighty fine title as his school&#39;s very first electric bass guitar player. As his passion for music grew stronger, he attended the Anderson University as a Music Major and graduated with a B.A. in Music and a concentration on Double Bass, in the year of 2005. From here, Brandon immediately moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to further pursue his career as a professional musician. 

In spite of his early age, Brandon has become one of the most respected and sought after bass players in the realm of music. With the soul of Motown session players from yesteryear, this sultan of swing quickly indulged in collaborations with a wide palette of well-known artist, during which he was introduced to a great variety of musical genres, such as country, hip hop, rock, jazz, bluegrass, R&amp;B, gospel, classical, funk and pop.

Through great determination, incomparable attention to tone and a vast knowledge of musical theory, this equilibrist has adapted a quite unique approach to playing his instrument - a true and hardworking harbinger of the bass guitar.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Brent Hinds is the lead guitarist and singer for technical hybrid metal band Mastodon.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Brent&#39;s guitar sound is unique and easily recognizable. Playing the banjo as a child, Hinds learned his &quot;signature style&quot; of fast hybrid picking by emulating banjo fingerings on the guitar. He frequently utilizes the minor pentatonic, natural minor and the harmonic minor scales in his playing as well as many hammer-ons, pull-offs and legato slides.

Mastodon was formed in 1999, after Brent and Troy, who were in a band together, met the other members at a High On Fire concert and decided to meet up for a jam. They soon discovered that they had a common passion for sludge metal and the hard rock genre and decided to form a band.

Over the years, Mastodon has released the critically appraised albums &#39;Remission&#39;, &#39;Leviathan&#39;, &#39;Blood Mountain&#39;, &#39;Crack the Sky&#39; and &#39;The Hunter&#39; - of which the latter has sold over 75.000 copies in the US as of 2012 and reached number 19 on the UK album chart and number 10 on the Billboard 200.

Like the rest of Mastodon&#39;s vocalists, Brent became a singer more by accident than by choice, when the original singer suddenly left the band and they were unable to find a replacement in time for an upcoming tour. Since then, the mix of different vocal styles has become an integral part of Mastodon&#39;s unmistakable trademark sound.

In 2007, Brent Hinds and fellow Mastodon guitarist Bill Kelliher won the Metal Hammer Golden Gods awards for best shredders. In 2011, music magazines Metal Hammer, Classic Rock and Rock Sound all voted Mastodon&#39;s album The Hunter as best record of the year. Furthermore, BBC stated about Mastodon: &#39;They are the most ambitious, most fearless, most fun heavy metal band to have breached the mainstream since the genre oozed its way out of the Midlands in the 1970s.&quot;

While Hinds&#39; main focus is on Mastodon, he&#39;s also pulling guitar and vocal duties for the surfabilly band Fiend Without a Face, and is also involved in other projects such as classic rock bands The Blood Vessels, West End Motel, Four Hour Fogger, The Last of the Blue Eyed Devils and, his newest project, the supergroup Giraffe Tongue Orchestra with fellow guitarist Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, former bassist of Jane&#39;s Addiction, Eric Avery and  former The Mars Volta drummer, Jon Theodore. Hinds furthermore composed the score for the movie Jonah Hex.

Mastodon is known to be heavy users of guitar effects and Brent&#39;s impressive pedalboard of course includes several TC pedals, such as the Shaker vibrato, Corona chorus, Flashback delay and the Polytune.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Brett Scallions is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for post-grunge rock band Fuel. He has been a responsible for unforgettable hit songs such as &#39;Hemorrhage&#39;, &#39;Bad Day&#39; and &#39;Shimmer&#39;.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Brett Allen Scallions is an American musician from Brownsville, Tennessee. He is currently the lead singer and rhythm guitar player for the current lineup of multi platinum rock band Fuel, after being the vocalist for the original incarnation of the band from 1993 to 2005. Fuel burst onto the scene in mid-1998 with the release of &quot;Shimmer&quot; and slowly but surely built a following of fans. The band has released multiple albums including the double platinum Something Like Human. After Scallions left Fuel, he joined a band called The X&#39;s playing bass. The X&#39;s released one album before going on &quot;hiatus.&quot; He also recently joined Circus Diablo, a Los Angeles-based rock band while simultaneously playing with the X&#39;s. In March 2007, Scallions was selected as the singer for Riders on the Storm, a project featuring former The Doors members Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek. On March 9, 2010, the single &quot;Something to Believe&quot; by Hollow featuring Brett Scallions and Ken Wallace was released. In 2011 Fuel is re-formed again with vocalist Brett Scallions and it soon was made official that Brett and the members of Re-Fueled had become the new incarnation of Fuel. Outside Re-Fueled, Scallions has been busy with Sean Danielsen of Smile Empty Soul and producer Eddie Wall, writing and recording an album under the name World Fire Brigade - a much heavier act than Fuel, very deep and even growly at times. At NAMM 2011, Scallions stated that the World Fire Brigade album is due out this year. He also stated that World Fire Brigade would tour and play select shows. 

When TC Electronic approached him to create his own unique TonePrints, Scallions was immediately onboard. He says, &quot;I have always loved TC Electronic stuff. They always make great stuff. Great pedals, great racks. I wanted to check these new pedals out as I was told you can save your settings and I was very intrigued by that.&quot; Scallions went on to create two of his own TonePrints called the Onion Delay and the Spring Onion.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Brian &#39;Head&#39; Welch is the founder of Love and Death, Co-founder of KORN and a true metal head by heart. He has inspired many with his marvelous skills on the guitar. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a child Welch originally wanted to play drums. We can all thank his father for persuading him otherwise by pointing out the difficulty of carrying around a drum kit. If he hadn&#39;t, KORN might not have the distinctive sound that defined the nu metal aesthetic beginning in the mid 90s. 

In 1993 something awesome happened for Welch. The band L.A.P.D was looking for a new guitarist. They collaborated with Welch and formed the band creep. It was not the final-version band because soon after singer Jonathan Davis joined and KORN was born. KORN reached massive success and became one of the top-selling hard rock groups. Welch stayed in the band for 12 years before deciding to change his scenery. He released the deep and emotional album &#39;Save me from myself&#39; under his own name. It was a tough beginning for Welch as he completely had a fresh start. He was used to playing live gigs in front of thousands yet with his new project he played for just hundreds. In 2012 Welch decided to separate his business in two. His book releases and public speaking&#39;s remained under &#39;Brian Head Welch&#39; and he re-branded his solo-project with the band name &#39;Love and Death&#39;.

After 7 years on his own without much contact with his previous band members from KORN, Welch appeared in a show with them in May 2012. This led to him appearing with the band in more shows and finally in May 2013 Welch rejoined the band officially. He did not abandon Love and Death but works simultaneously with both projects. 

In addition to making must-hear music and writing inspiring books Welch is the principal organizer and representative of The Whosoevers. An outreach organization and product-line founded with Sonny Sandoval (P.O.D) and Ryan Ries. The organization is set out to build and strengthen the youth of today, inspiring their creativity and stand together to make a difference. Welch has the intent to positively impact today&#39;s music, skateboarding and art culture.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[&#39;The Show Most Go On&#39;, &#39;We will Rock You&#39; and &#39;I Want It All&#39; are classic hits that we have all sung our hearts out to at some point, and all of them have the signature of world-renowned guitarist Brian May.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Brian May really needs no introduction as one of the worlds most influential guitarists. His work with Queen and beyond over the last 40 years is virtually un-paralleled in the history of popular music, with the band having hit after hit album and singles, as well as sold out tours around the globe. Their legacy cannot be described fully in words, one can only admire their talent.

After the untimely death of Freddie Mercury in 1991, Queen went their separate ways for a while. Brian decided to focus on his solo career and in 1993, he published his first solo album, &#39;Back to Light&#39;, which was a sizable hit across Europe. In 2005, Queen was revived, this time with Paul Rodgers as the lead singer.

Brian has a proven talent as an excellent songwriter and guitarist and he has collaborated with numerous recording artists like Robbie Williams, Foo Fighters and Lady Gaga to mention a few. His past and present influence as a rock guitarist is a constant encouragement to artists around the world and we are extremely proud that an icon of Brian&#39;s magnitude uses TC Electronic&#39;s flagship guitar effects processors to perfect his sound.

Pete Malandrone is the tech that sets and tunes all of Brian&#39;s gear and we asked him a couple of questions about Brian&#39;s rack:

TC: How did you hear about TC&#39;s gear in the first place?

Pete: When I took over the tech responsibilities - after about a year of working mainly in the studio - I set about improving the guitar rig in as many ways as possible. One of the things that used to bug me was the &#39;glitching&#39; in almost any pitch changer I tried. I nailed it down to processing speed, and then called a few people to see what they thought was the best and fastest guitar processor I could get my hands on. The name TC came up in a few conversations, so I got hold of one, and found it to be perfect for what Brian needed. 

TC: How are you using the gear and how has it changed the way you work?

Pete: Once I got my head around the menus, I found that the G-major&#39;s were better than the gear I was using at the time for a lot of effects, not just the pitch shift stuff. I like the chorus, and now the G-major 2 has a longer delay time, I like that too. The main thing is I know them inside out and I trust them. I have never had to send one back and I have never had one go wrong on me. That counts for a lot in my line of work. You have to be confident in the equipment as well as the sound they make.

TC: What do you find most useful about the gear in terms of features?

Pete: The &#39;kill dry&#39; option is brilliant for me. The way I run the rig makes it so important that I don&#39;t get any original signal to the effects amps. I really love that I can hit that button and know I don&#39;t have to scroll through pages of menus trying to find a bit of spurious dry signal from somewhere.
The &#39;phase reverse&#39; option on the chorus is a great feature. It basically stops the phantom center of the effected stereo signal from interfering with the center dry mono signal in the three-amp setup we use.

Pete sums up that retaining Brian&#39;s classic sound is the most important thing - and TC&#39;s gear allows him to spike Brian&#39;s tunes without tainting his tones with unnecessary processing noise or gain structures.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Ron Thal, aka Bumblefoot, started playing the guitar at age 6 after hearing the Kiss Alive! album. That was some 40 years ago, and since then, he just continued to play, start bands, write music, make demos, play gigs, teach, build his own guitars, engineer and produce other bands. In fact, he has been releasing music for over 20 years, with one of the highlights surely being his stint in the legendary rock band Guns N&#39; Roses.

Bumblefoot&#39;s latest solo record &quot;Little Brother Is Watching&quot; is an eccentric, upbeat collection of epic, modern rock with haunting melodies, huge choruses and witty lyrics about life in the digital age and beyond. The album was composed, produced, recorded, mixed and mastered by Bumblefoot at his own studio, and includes a crowd of 100 fans stomping, chanting and singing backing vocals recorded at a listening party in New York. The album peaked at #4 on Amazon.com Rock charts globally.

Bumblefoot&#39;s recent collaborations include rock group Art Of Anarchy (featuring Creed vocalist Scott Stapp and Disturbed bassist John Moyer), and progressive group Sons Of Apollo (featuring Mike Portnoy, Billy Sheehan, Derek Sherinian and Jeff Scott Soto).

Bumblefoot is also an accomplished composer whose music is often heard in TV, film and video games, including the theme song to VH1&#39;s &quot;That Metal Show&quot;. Bumblefoot has worked as an adjunct Professor at SUNY Purchase College teaching music production, works with U.S. Embassies around the world on cross-cultural music programs, has his own line of award-winning hot sauces, and works with dozens of international charities visiting orphanages and children&#39;s hospitals around the world with guitar in hand.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Carles Benavent, aka La Garza Flamenca, was born and raised in the Barcelonan neighbourhood Poble Sec in the 1950s. At an age of thirteen, when Carles first started playing the bass, he was attracted to the bluesy and rocky tunes of the time - Jimi Hendrix in particular.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a musician Carles was driven to the tragic expressiveness of both the blues and flamenco rhythms, and found a certain appeal in the very feeling and exaggerated expressions of the flamenco style of playing. Being an autodidact bass player, Carles quickly started picking up his own and very distinct Flamenco style, using both fingers and pick to pluck the strings.

Soon Carles began to play alongside even the most distinguished Spanish jazz musicians, and in 1980 he joined one of the finest flamenco musicians, Paco de Luc&#237;a, forming the legendary Paco de Luc&#237;a sextet - a part that would later earn him his nickname La Garza Flamenca. Touring in Europe, America and Japan he began a prolific collaborative journey with various recognized flamenco artists including Paco de Luc&#237;a and legendary Camar&#243;n de la Isla.

After the release of his fourth album &#39;Ag&#252;ita que Corre&#39; in 1995 Carles injured his left arm in a tragic traffic accident. Although incapable of playing music for almost a year, his passion for music drew him back on stage to once again perform with his friend Paco de Luc&#237;a.

Throughout his career Carles Benavent has been playing with a vast variety of artists such as Chick Corea and Miles Davis, and his astonishing talent has proven a major role in flamenco music in general. The efforts of this fine musician have resulted in a great number of records including a variety of solo albums, of which the first was released in 1983. In 2011 Carles released his latest album &#39;Un Dos Tres&#39;. An album that features a variety of special guest musicians.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Charles Cave is the youthful bassist, backing vocalist and the primary songwriter in the Indie rockers White Lies. The band, which started off as &#39;Fear of Flying&#39;, transformed into the White Lies persona in 2007 to better match their evolving style of music. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Cave actually started playing &#39;bass&#39; on his dad&#39;s acoustic six-string guitar, learning songs from his favorite bands Pantera and Black Sabbath, before eventually graduating to a real bass. It was at this point that Cave truly started developing his own sound, which developed into the band Fear of Flying and eventually White Lies. 

Over the years, Cave has become an indispensable part of the White Lies line-up to whom he contributes on a variety of fronts. Although a bassist and backing vocalist to the public eye, he is also the mastermind behind White Lies&#39; songwriting, an aspect of music that Cave is determined to become more and more involved in.
In February of 2008, just five months after their transformation, White Lies earned a recording contract with Fiction Records just days after their debut performance. Ever since the start, White Lies has shown sky-high potential as their song &#39;Death&#39; was even named &quot;Hottest Record in the World&quot; by BBC Radio 1&#39;s Zane Lowe on the 5th of February 2008 - despite not even having been officially released yet. Upon the release of their debut album &#39;To Lose My Life&#39; in early 2009, White Lies became the first British act in 2009 to achieve a number one album and the first to debut at number one as well. Needless to say, White Lies broke into the spotlight in an extravagant manner and the following success of the album was spearheaded by singles such as &#39;Death&#39;, &#39;Unfinished Business&#39; and &#39;To Lose My Life&#39;. 

At the beginning of 2009, White Lies featured in multiple &quot;ones to watch&quot; polls for the coming year, including the BBC&#39;s Sound of 2009 poll and the 2009 BRITs Critics&#39; Choice Award. White Lies&#39; musical style has been described as dark yet uplifting by the media, drawing comparisons to Joy Division, Editors and Interpol.
In 2011, White Lies continued on their quest for international fame &amp; glory with the release of their second album &#39;Ritual&#39;. Their success has also meant sold out shows throughout their world tours, which have included Europe, North America and Japan, as well as appearances at some of the world&#39;s largest music festivals, such as Glastonbury, Roskilde, Lollapalooza and Rock Werchter.

Cave is a user of TC&#39;s Flashback Delay and Corona Chorus for which he has also lent his time and style to create a couple of very useful TonePrints. At TC, we are delighted that Charles Cave opted to reduce the weight and increase the available space on his pedalboard by choosing the PolyTune Mini for tuning purposes.  ]]></artistBio2>

								<youtubeDescription><![CDATA[For the Corona Chorus, Charles Cave created the &#39;Goth Bullshit&#39; TonePrint that was reminiscent of a classic chorus sound despite it being a classic analogue sounding tri-chorus. The chorus is slow and without a lot of depth making it a very precise tone and one that is very subtle or &#39;bass playerish&#39; as Cave puts it.

Cave&#39;s intent was to create a subtle delay but the result was in fact the opposite. It is a tape delay that adds a long feedback and spreads like an invisible reverb. Cave recommends this TonePrint to be used as a solo effect using the higher pitched bass notes.]]></youtubeDescription>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Chip Shearin is a highly recognized bass player, composer and an astonishing record producer. On top of performing and producing, he runs KEO Music Recordings, an indie label distributed by Warner Bros.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Most people have at some point in their life heard Chip Shearin&#39;s tantalizing bass playing on the rap landmark &quot;Rapper&#39;s Delight&quot; by Sugarhill Gang. Just 17 years old, Shearin played the song&#39;s bass line on the recording. Originally composed by Chic bassist Bernard Edwards, it&#39;s one of the most recognizable bottom ends in all of popular music. Released in 1979, it was the first rap song to get mainstream air play and launched an entire genre.

Chip, a native of North Carolina, calls Los Angeles, California 
home but still enjoys his roots in North Carolina. He studied music at Duke University as well as the Manhattan School of Music. Shearin has taught in the music department at N.C. Central University and also lectures about the business of music at colleges across the country. 

Shearin&#39;s part in &quot;Rapper&#39;s Delight&quot; was a total coincidence, but it was the spark that ignited a long successful career. He was on his way to music school, visiting a friend in New Jersey, who knew a studio owner named Sylvia Robinson. Robinson did a lot of R&amp;B recording sessions at her studio and needed players, so Shearin was asked if he was interested in earning some extra cash. His job was to lay down the groove from the Chic song &quot;Good Times&quot; for an unheard-of 15 minutes straight, with no mistakes; a challenging task - and remember, this was before samplers! - but he was thrilled with the $70 he made for it.

The Rock N Roll Hall of Fame has acknowledged &quot;Rapper&#39;s Delight&quot; a number of times, including it in an exhibit called &quot;Roots Rhyme &amp; Rage: The Hip Hop Story&quot;, and hosting a 30th anniversary concert. Chip&#39;s story and the bass played during that session have also become part of the main Rock Hall Exhibit. In Rolling Stone Magazine&#39;s 2004 listing of  &quot;Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, the song came in at no. 248.  This past year &quot;Rapper&#39;s Delight&quot; was added to the  U.S. National Archives Recording Registry - the highest honor for a song.

When asked what the song has meant for his career, Shearin says, &#39;For the sake of musical value to me, that was absolutely zero. I wanted to be Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke, so the last thing I wanted to be known for was playing that song.&quot; Financially, Shearin never made anything more than that original $70 off of &quot;Rapper&#39;s Delight,&quot; but he explains that, through his career, the song has been a nice calling card.

Shearin played a few live dates backing up Sugarhill Gang after &quot;Rapper&#39;s Delight&quot; and went on to a solid career as a traveling session bassist, playing and recording with many pop and jazz artists such as Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera, Faith Evans, Michael Bolton, George Howard, Kirk Whalum, Bob Baldwin, Marion Meadows, Bob James, Steve Reid, Howard Hewitt, Phil Perry, Special EFX, Jeff Kashiwa, Ceilli Minuchi, Polina, Pieces of a Dream and YahZarah.

The latest project in Chip&#39;s amazing career has been providing the music and laying down the bass for the trailers and various fight scenes in Iron Man 3.

Chip needs his gear to be as flexible as possible for both stage and studio use. He found that in the RH750 head along with RS410 and RS210 cabinets: &#39;It&#39;s got the flexibility to be set up any way you need - I can&#39;t think of a room where you couldn&#39;t play with this.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Chris Minh Doky is arguably one of the most proficient bass players in Jazz today. Equally adept at double- and electric bass, Chris has known runaway success as both a soloist and as a sideman, where he worked with everyone from Mike Stern to David Sanborn.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Chris Minh Doky is a true first-call musician on the international jazz scene. He was born in Denmark, and at an early age, he decided to become a professional jazz bassist. Chris was extremely determined to achieve this goal, so he moved from Copenhagen to New York City at age 18 - just fresh out of high school. Here he approached the jazz dream the old fashioned way and played tons of gigs everywhere with everybody - for little to no pay. However, his talent was obvious, and rumor had it that there was a new cat in town. Soon, Chris&#39; career skyrocketed, and over the years he has performed and/or recorded with such great musicians as David Sanborn, Michael Brecker, Peter Erskine, Al Jarreau, Toots Thielemans, Randy Brecker, Mike Stern, Dave Weckl, John Scofield, Jeff &#39;Tain&#39; Watts, Michel Camilo and Trilok Gurtu - just to name a few!

Chris dropped by us here at TC Electronic, and we grabbed the opportunity to ask him a bit about his experience with his Bass Amp 2.0 gear.

&#39;TC Electronic&#39;s high quality level intrigued me to try out the new bass gear when I got the chance,&#39; Chris says and goes on. &#39;Especially the three user memory feature piqued my curiosity as I always use at least two basses. One upright and one electric and if it worked out, I could get rid of my switch pedal. Therefore, I decided to get the RH450 amp plus two cabinets, RS210 and RS212, and it simply sounds amazing. Also, it&#39;s very easy to use and another major advantage is that it accepts voltages between 100v-240v, which is essential for me as I play all over the world.&#39;
&#39;It turned out that the user memories worked great for me, so I did actually drop my switch pedal,&#39; Chris tells us. &#39;Oh, and another neat feature that may not be so well known is that you can actually use the digital AES/EBU output to send a signal, which is independent from the Line Out signal that typically goes to the Front of House mixer. I use the AES/EBU output to send an independent signal to my stage monitor. Overall, this new bass gear has just made my life a lot easier when touring and it allows me to focus 100% on the important thing, playing music.&#39;

We also asked Chris a bit about his general approach to playing music and about his plans for the near future.


&#39;Well, basically, I always aim at becoming one with the music. No matter what the situation or musical genre, that is my primary goal when I play. As for the future, I have a European tour coming up with my band, The Nomads, including Dave Weckl on drums, Dean Brown on guitar and George Whitty on keyboards, and further, I have just released an album called &#39;Scenes From a Dream&#39;, featuring Larry Goldings and Peter Erskine.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Though it may seem clich&#233;, some artists are meant to be in the spotlight, the focus of attention, the center of the universe, while others are meant to be the spotlight itself, the device of illumination that serves to place the focus on other people or things with its radiance.
For multi-instrumentalist, producer Chris Parks, the latter holds true, which isn&#39;t to say that his talent takes a backseat to anyone&#39;s, but rather that half of his talents have been honed to be used best in highlighting others&#39; work.

To date Parks has performed as a musician with such notables as Amel Larrieux, Elisabeth Withers, Rashaan Patterson, George Duke, Najee, Joe Sample, David Sanborn, Reuben Wilson, Patti Austin, Deborah Cox, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, and was the musical director for Lalah Hathaway for over 15 years.

While tackling the field of live performance, Parks&#39; unknowingly began work on what would be his next challenge, that of a producer/engineer. What began as recording demos for students and other musicians during his time at Berklee College, ultimately led to the creation of SuprDupr Sound Studios, a large scale recording operation nestled in Brooklyn&#39;s artistic D.U.M.B.O. neighborhood.

As a producer, Parks worked tirelessly, remixing songs by artists such as: Brandy, Regina Carter, Taylor Dayne, Tamia, Dianne Reeves, Sean Levert, and Paula Cole. In addition, Parks has also written, mixed and or produced for a number of artists including jazz artists Khani Cole &amp; Jeff Kashiwa, Freedom Bremner (Star Search), Mario Vazquez (American Idol), Amel Larrieux, and Lalah Hathaway.

As an engineer/mixer, Chris has worked with Roberta Flack, Amel Larrieux, Will Downing, Casey Benjamin and numerous others. He has also composed or produced commercial jingles for such heavyweight clients as Canon, Cover Girl, Volvo, Dark &amp; Lovely and X-Box and in addition, had the title track in the film Moonlight Serenade in 2009 (starring Amy Adams &amp; Alec Newman)
Parks along with writing partner Vivian Sessoms released a debut cd in 2007 entitled Sunny One Day, under the moniker of &#39;Albright&#39; to much favorable praise. As a follow up, Chris has a solo project in the works, which he says will be a mash-up of styles, along with a new release from partner Sessoms, which the two are producing together.

In looking over Parks&#39; body of work, it becomes abundantly clear that it glistens with the names of collaborators that clearly belong in the spotlight. It also becomes increasingly clear, however, that in many cases the very spotlight is Chris Parks himself.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Starting his career as a live-sound engineer during the early 1970s, Danny Vicari has since handled sound engineering for such leading artists as AC/DC, Chick Corea and Bobby McFerrin. He is now the owner of LAFX Studios, based in Los Angeles. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[LAFX Studios originally began life in 1988 as an audio-equipment rental company for major recording facilities, record producers, engineers and movie studios. Six years later, Danny purchased a mixing console and the LAFX recording studio became a reality. 

Today, LAFX is still going strong, with an enviable reputations as a high-quality rental facility, while the recording studio remains one of the &#39;truest&#39; sounding mix rooms in Southern California. 

Over the years, Danny has used a range of TC Electronic products for sound production. &#39;I&#39;ve always used a lot of TC products,&#39; he offers. &#39;It all started with the TC 2290, which is still one of the main-stay delays that we use here at the studio. It&#39;s always been my favorite for delay, and is still the first choice for live sound. Through the years I&#39;ve used the M2000, the M3000 and I even carry a Nova Delay pedal with me, just in case I&#39;m out somewhere in Eastern Europe and I can&#39;t get the equipment I need, such as the 2290.&#39;

The System 6000 remains a key element in all of Danny&#39;s productions. &#39;The most-used reverbs and delays here in the studio are from the System 6000,&#39; the engineer states. &#39;We&#39;ve used those for both music and movies in both stereo and surround. Also in terms of rentals, the System 6000 is the most popular.&#39;

A major application for the System 6000 has been for the Oscar&#174; Show, for which Danny himself handles both design and setup for the orchestra at the venue used for all the pre-records; LAFX also has one or two 6000 units at the venue for the audio production truck. 

Danny and his many clients use an assortment of different algorithms for System 6000, both in the studio and with outside productions. &quot;In a live application, I most often end up using the large hall reverbs,&#39; he continues. &#39;I really like the large halls; they always sound great. But I also use Room, Hall and Plate, depending upon what is appropriate for the specific project. My clients have also used the Unwrap application on many projects, such as AC/DC and Jimi Hendrix DVD and album releases.&#39;

Asked about typical uses of the System 6000 in the studio, Danny says: &#39;I do a lot of live recordings of the shows that we do. Sometimes, you want to add a nice little &#39;sheen,&#39; or you want to have a room sound simulation; it&#39;s great for those applications. Actually, it&#39;s often the only thing I use, since I always try to make it sound as natural as possible. With the System 6000, you can do anything - you can make it sound like a room or a studio recording. It&#39;s very successful here.&#39;

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Darren Moore is the Chief Engineer at Manhattan Center Studios in New York, the home of two of the world&#39;s most unique, elegant and prestigious event rooms, The Hammerstein and The Grand Ballroom. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Darren got into the music business by playing in bands and at cultural centers from a young age, and by the time he was in college, he was part of a band that was making traction in the New York black rock scene. 

But what he really wanted was to make records, so he started making demos with friends in someone&#39;s bedroom with a four-track recorder. The band broke up, but at that time, he already had one foot in the studio door. He attended a high school that was based on interning for credits, and from there he made his way into making jingles, music for film and TV, and records with major artists. 

After high school, he started working as an assistant at a midtown Manhattan studio. The place had a 2 inch tape large format console and the first version of Pro Tools. There, he got to work with many talented people and taught himself all about Pro Tools and how to work it. Then he moved on to The Hit Factory NY and was later taken on as the Chief of Operations at Platinum Sound NYC. He is currently the Chief Engineer at Manhattan Center Studios NYC.

Darren is a long time user of TC Electronic gear. We caught up with him to talk about his TC Electronic products:

&quot;There was always a 2290 in any studio in New York that you would want to work in and it was always the best dynamic digital delay in the room - I learned how to get really great flangers and effects from it. Plus, the sampler was a really great studio tool before samplers became available everywhere&quot;.

Darren&#39;s arsenal includes the PolyTune, the 2290 and the 1210 Spatial Expander: &#39;The tuner is always in line for guitar and bass recording and it&#39;s the best in this autotune world, where people&#39;s ears are so sensitive to tuning. The 2290 is still the best DDL&#39;s in any rack and I use the spatial expander to enhance tracks and give them a special sound depth and fullness. I use the DDL&#39;s on lead vocals to give them a clean trail. I love the spatial expander on guitar packages coming out of Pro Tools, or even on background vocals as an effect&#39;.

When asked if he had any secret tricks when recording, Darren replied, &quot;Just the spatial expander on vocals. I kind of love flangers in background vocals - but the 1210 is so much more than just a flanger&quot;.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[For more than 30 years Darryl Jones has played with some of the greatest legends of the jazz and rock world. For many he is best known for his gig with The Rolling Stones ranging from 1994 and onwards.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Jones grew up in Chicago, Illinois with music in his blood. His father was a drummer and supported Jones&#39;s interest in music, teaching him drums and how to read music.

Sold on a career in music, he entered Chicago Vocational High School, where he took theory courses and played electric bass in stage bands. Upon graduating, he began to establish himself on the local scene. Jones&#39;s band-mate Vince Wilburn Jr. (a nephew of Miles Davis), got him an audition with his legendary uncle - an opportunity Darryl didn&#39;t hesitate to seize. A week later Darryl found himself on stage with Miles Davis, guitarist Mike Stern, guitarist John Scofield, saxophonist Bill Evans, percussionist Mino Cinelu, and drummer Al Foster. 

After playing with Miles for two years, Jones moved on to join Sting&#39;s jazz band and toured with him on &#39;The Dream of the Blue Turtles&#39; tour for a year before returning to Miles. 

Since then Jones has played with musical giants such as John Scofield, Herbie Hancock, Eric Clapton, Peter Gabriel and Madonna. Jones&#39; most well known gig, however, is the one with Rolling Stones, going on for more than 20 years.

Darryl Jones, the man who went big from day one, has had an impressive career and keeps rocking it with the Rolling Stones. He has always followed one simple musical philosophy: &#39;My approach to all music is: break it down, cut away the excess, and get back to the fundamentals.&quot;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Dave Catching stands as a true godfather of stoner and desert rock. The list of artists he has worked with through the years is endless, but he is most famous for wielding the guitar with bands such as Queens of the Stoneage and Eagles of Death Metal]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Dave Catching is best known for his work with The Queens of the Stone Age and The Eagles of Death Metal , but he has been playing with many different bands in genres such as Desert Rock, Stoner Rock and Garage Rock Revival. Well, most kinds of &#39;Rock&#39; actually. Dave grew up in a musical family and his brother, Jack, taught him to play the guitar. Over the years, Dave played with tons of bands, and one day he was offered to go to Europe on a tour as guitar tech for a band called Kyuss. He became close friends with the band, and when the band broke up a few years later, Joshua Homme that played with Kyuss and Dave started playing and recording together as Queens of the Stone Age. After three years, Dave went on and focused on playing with &#39;earthlings?&#39;, which was a project that had been started years back. Later, in 2003, Dave started playing with Eagles of Death Metal. Along the way, Dave also established a recording studio with a friend and sound-engineer, Fred Drake, that used to record his bands. They own the &#39;Rancho de la Luna&#39; studio in Jushua Tree, California, so Dave is also into studio gear and producing music. We asked Dave about his TC Electronic products. &#39;My TC 2290 Digital Delay is always in line,&#39; Dave says. &#39;Back in 1993, one of the first pieces of gear that Fred and I ever bought was a used 2290. I use it a lot on vocals, although I do love it for guitar and keys just as much. It&#39;s always crystal clear, always sounds great and it&#39;s so reliable - never had a problem. I seriously love it, and since it&#39;s been reliable for so long, it lead me to try many other TC Electronic products. I have never been let down, and all of my TC products find use at my studio and for live performances. For instance, I use TC reverbs and my RH450 bass rig a lot in the studio. Plus, I have all the TonePrint and Nova pedals, and I use them during almost every session for guitar, bass, keys, etc. Someone always finds a cool use for them. When it comes to my live setup, I just love the new Flashback Delay and the amazing PolyTune tuner never leaves my board.&#39;
So, how about an overall approach to playing and recoding music? &#39;My overall approach is to get everything nicely mic&#39;ed up, set a nice vibe and just go with the flow,&#39; Dave says. &#39;The vibe always wins over the technical side. If you can achieve both, that&#39;s the best, of course, but first of all, you want everyone comfortable and into it. Also, I love experimentation, and I really enjoy bringing out all the pedals and plugging them in to find sonic landscapes that might otherwise go uncharted.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Dave Murray is one of the earliest members of the legendary heavy metal group Iron Maiden. His galloping guitar-riffs, aggressive arpeggios and levitating legato runs can be heard on all of the group&#39;s albums.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[For more that 35 years Dave Murray has been one of the driving forces behind Iron Maiden - the group that in retrospect stands as pioneers of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal - all the way from the time of their initial success in the early 1980s, over the classic years with &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;, &quot;Powerslave&quot;, &quot;Live After Death&quot; and &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, to their latest album &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;.

Dave&#39;s sound is highly recognizable, primarily based on the legato style solo variety. Through the years this has been a part of Maidens trademark sound and can be heard on songs all the way back from the first self-titled album, such as &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;, to songs from &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;.

Dave&#39;s mainstay guitar is a US Fender Stratocaster equipped with and a Floyd Rose tremolo system. He primarily uses Seymour Duncan Hot Rails and JB Jnr pickups. He gets his aggressively distorted sound from the Marshall EL34 100/100 Rack Mount Power Amp and a pair of 300w Marshall 1960-cabinets. In addition to this Murray uses the TC Electronic G-Force System live and in the studio - for that little extra something.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Dave Stewart, the world-famous British-born legendary musician, producer, author, filmmaker, philanthropist and innovator really needs no introduction. He is regarded as an iconic figure in the world of music and beyond. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Stewart&#39;s musical career alone spans more than three decades. Behind the scenes, he has produced albums and co-written songs for Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty, Bono, Sinead O&#39;Connor, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, Jon Bon Jovi and many others. Stewart has been honored for his work by winning numerous Producer, Songwriter and Grammy Awards on his musical path. One of his greatest musical achievements counts the collaboration with Annie Lennox in the groundbreaking pop-rock group Eurythmics with whom he sold more than 100 million albums. 

Described by Bob Dylan as a fearless innovator, Stewart and his company &#39;Weapons of Mass Entertainment&#39; have been at the forefront of innovation linking creative ideas to projects in film, television, books, theatre and new media.

Born David Allan Stewart in 1952 in Sunderland England. In his teens while living in London, he got a record deal for his folk rock band Longdancer, without achieving any commercial success. In late 1976 Stewart got introduced to Annie Lennox but it was not until 1980 that Lennox and Stewart went on to launch Eurythmics. The band&#180;s global breakthrough came with the release of their second album &#39;Sweet Dreams&#39; (Are Made of This) in 1983.

Around 1989, after releasing eight studio albums, Eurythmics disbanded without any official notice and Stewart began writing film soundtracks. A year later he achieved international success with the instrumental track &#39;Lily Was Here&#39; featuring saxophonist Candy Dulfer for the Dutch film &#39;De Kassi&#232;re&#39;.

In the early &#39;90s Stewart formed a band called &#39;The Spiritual Cowboys&#39; who went on releasing two albums. In between mid and late &#39;90s Stewart also managed to release two solo albums entitled &#39;Greetings from the Gutter&#39; (1995) and &#39;Sly-Fi&#39; (1998), which was released on the Internet exclusively.

In the years to come Eurythmics reunited a few times under different circumstances, but Stewart continued along his own creative path. In 2002 he was the driving force behind the Nelson Mandela 46664 campaign for which he recorded few songs together with Paul McCartney, Bono and Edge of U2. Linking his musical talent and inspiration to charitable causes Stewart also organized campaigns against HIV/AIDS and got involved with Greenpeace.

Not surprisingly, for the past few years Stewart has been busy. He co-produced and co-wrote the new Joss Stone and the new Stevie Nicks record &#39;In Your Dreams&#39; with whom he went touring. Stewart has also recently formed a group called SuperHeavy consisting of an interesting line up of musicians from different genres counting Mick Jagger, Joss Stone, A.R.Rahman and Damian &#39;Jr Gong&#39; Marley.

In 2010 Stewart went to Nashville Tennessee to record his latest solo album &#39;The Blackbird Diaries&#39; including duets by Stevie Nicks, Martina McBride among other artists. Currently Stewart and Stone continue to join forces in yet another concept; &#39;The More Love Tour&#39; inviting special guests along the way. Not to forget, Stewart recently collaborated with Glenn Ballard for writing Ghost the Musical that showed in London and is scheduled for Broadway this year.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[For the last 13 years, the only constant in Steve Vai&#39;s touring career has been guitarist Dave Weiner.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Fresh out of college back in Pennsylvania with an Accounting degree, Dave moved to Los Angeles in 1998 to attend Musician&#39;s Institute: Guitar Institute of Technology.

&#39;No matter how many years of schooling I went through, after it was over, I always said I was heading to LA to go to GIT,&#39; explains Dave. &#39;Since I was 10 years old, I knew guitar was my calling… and school in sunny LA where I play guitar all day sounds like a great place to get something started.&#39;

&#39;I knew once I was in LA, I had to start meeting people.  I was at GIT to learn and play to get to a level where I could sustain a career playing music, but if I was the best at what I did and no one knew about it, what good is that?&#39;

So, the first day of school, Dave found MI&#39;s job board. &#39;There were probably 50 pieces of paper stapled up on this board. I happened to find one that said &#39;…small artist management firm seeks intern. Make your own hours…&#39; I was interested in learning what a manager does and making my own hours was exactly what I needed to do. There were no names; just a fax number.  So I faxed my resume in. That night I got a call from a woman from the firm. We chatted and she eventually named her clients, the last of which was Steve Vai.  She asked if I knew who he was… of course.&#39;
 
So Dave took the internship doing basic office tasks. &#39;I&#39;d get mail, lunch, process orders, etc. Very basic office stuff while I was observing and learning the day-to-days in a management firm. Once in a while I&#39;d take some papers to Vai. Every time I met him he called me a different name, but at that point, that was fine with me. I&#39;d correct him and just try to be professional&#39;.

After a year at GIT, Dave was asked by some recording students if he&#39;d be willing to perform a few songs for their final project and said &quot;sure&quot;.  &quot;I told Vai I was going to be recording the demo. He said, &#39;Cool, let me hear it when it&#39;s done&#39;.&quot;

Dave tracked the demo, gave it to Steve and didn&#39;t hear anything about it. &#39;I figured it was just put into the pile of countless other demos Vai gets.&#39; Weeks went by until one Friday in September of 1999, the phone rings. It&#39;s Vai, &#39;…I really liked your demo. You can obviously play. I&#39;m about to start rehearsals for a world tour, I could use another guitar player. Would you like to join the band?&#39;

Forward to late 2000. One full world tour done, Dave&#39;s got some time off before the next and decides it&#39;s time to get things started with his own music. &quot;I was well received by the fans on the Vai tour, they were going to see me again, the market was right in front of my face.&#39;

So Dave started writing his debut instrumental record Shove The Sun Aside, which was recorded in between tours during the following years and released in 2004, then rereleased in 2005 after being licensed to Vai&#39;s label, Favored Nations. 

Since then, Weiner has released two more albums and has toured the world several times with Steve Vai.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[For close to 30 years guitarist/composer/arranger/educator Dean Brown has been an integral part of the global fusion and contemporary jazz scene. Those who have seen and heard Dean Brown perform are immediately struck by the passion and energy he puts into each note.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[His compositions are thoughtful and intense, yet lyrical vehicles for individual as well as group expression. Dean has recorded and/or toured around the world with his own projects and legendary artists such as: Marcus Miller, The Brecker Brothers, Billy Cobham, David Sanborn, Bob James, George Duke, Roberta Flack, Joe Zawinul, Lenny White, Kirk Whalum, and Steve Smith&#39;s Vital Information.

Brown has original compositions and arrangements featured on albums for Les McCann, Dennis Chambers, Ricky Peterson, Steve Smith&#39;s Vital Information, and Billy Cobham, among others.

Brown&#39;s soulful, dynamic and creative guitar work can be heard on well over 200 recordings, numerous GRAMMY&#174; nominations and four GRAMMY&#174; Award winners. Records such as The Brecker Brothers &#39; 

Return of the Brecker Brothers&#39; and &#39;Out Of The Loop&#39;, Marcus Millers &#39;The Sun Don&#39;t Lie&#39;, Billy Cobhams &#39;Warning&#39;, and Joe Zawinuls &#39;Faces and Places&#39; are just a few out of the long list. His performances include Live DVD&#39;s with Marcus Miller, Billy Cobham, Gil Evans, David Sanborn and Friends, Louie Belson, Bob James, and Steve Smith&#39;s Vital Information.

Dean has released four critically acclaimed solo CD&#39;s worldwide. The first, titled &#39;Here&#39; (2001), is his all-star debut CD featuring jazz greats Marcus Miller, David Sanborn, George Duke, Billy Cobham, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Christian McBride, Don Alias, Bill Evans, Bernard Wright and many others.
His second record &#39;Groove Warrior&#39;(2004), features another all-star lineup with Lalah Hathaway, Marcus Miller, Bernard Wright, JuJu House, Poogie Bell, Schuyler Deale, Booker King, and Patches Stewart, just to name a few.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Debra Killings is an American singer and bass guitarist, notable for an extensive session and background vocal work for LaFace Records and Rowdy Records-based artists such as TLC, Monica and OutKast.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Debra Killings may have propelled herself into a Gospel-tinted spotlight with her critically acclaimed debut long-player &#39;Surrender&#39; back in 2005, but after contributing to some of the biggest albums of the &#39;90s and beyond it&#39;s really no wonder she hit the ground running.

Debra has performed on over 60 major albums during her career, and while she&#39;s carved out a career singing backing vocals on most of TLC&#39;s back catalogue, she&#39;s also contributed heavily to LaFace Records and Rowdy Records stablemates Monica and Outkast.

Her extensive vocal range - from Urban to Gospel to Soul diva - has also seen her in demand further afield, featuring on releases by Aretha Franklin, Madonna, Toni Braxton and Da Brat, amongst many others.

While that&#39;s enough of a resume for most people, Debra ups the ante somewhat when you factor in her skill as a bass player, having contributed to the low-end frequencies of records by the likes of Carlos Santana, LL Cool J, Curtis Mayfield, Nelly and Jay-Z. No wonder she&#39;s one of R&amp;B&#39;s most in-demand session musicians and vocalists.

Did we mention that Debra&#39;s also a songwriter? How, with what must be an an already arduous schedule, she&#39;s managed to amass song-writing credits for the likes of George Clinton, Will Smith, Eternal and Paula Abdul is anybody&#39;s guess!

Despite these demands on her time, 2008 saw Debra finding time to put together a diverse range of tracks for &#39;Open Heaven&#39;, her sophomore album.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[American keyboardist Derek Sherinian has amazed all with his cool attitude topped off with an impressive and diverse resume. He has played and toured for A-list musicians including Alice Cooper, Billy Idol, Kiss and Black Label Society. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Derek Sherinian has made a true name for himself. He is a chameleon with an uncanny flexibility to work in various genres while maintaining his signature sound with his keyboard. He strives to work with the best within each genre and has succeeded doing so. 

With Elton John as his first hero, Sherinian began taking piano lessons at the age of 5. He enrolled at Berklee College of Music and upon graduation landed his first professional gig with Jimi Hendrix band of Gypsys&#39; drummer Buddy Miles.  After the Miles gig, Sherinian&#39;s old roommate from Berklee hooked him up with an audition to tour for Alice Cooper supporting Cooper&#39;s platinum selling album &#39;Thrash&#39;. He got in and stayed for three years playing more than 250 shows. 

Following his Alice Cooper tour Gene Simmons called Sherinian, asking him to join him on Kiss&#39;s revenge tour in 1992. Working with pioneers Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons was an incredible experience for Sherinian but unfortunately hard rock was on a downfall in the mid 90s and the gig ended when the tour did. 
Nonetheless, Shirinian did not rest long before luck struck him again. He auditioned for Dream Theater and was a key member of the group for four years. The group became the world&#39;s most beloved progressive hard rock band since Rush. Sherinian played on three releases with the group before moving on. 

In 2001 he joined Billy Idol&#39;s band by recommendation from Idol&#39;s guitarist Steve Stevens. Here he found a solid spot he enjoyed enough to stay and still be part of. 
After a decade with Idol, Sherinian was asked to record an album with Glen Huges, Jason Bonham and Joe Bonamassa.  This was the beginning of Black Country Communion. They released three albums and toured before disbanding where Sherinian went on and joined Joe Bonamassa&#39;s solo band. 

Since 1999, Sherinian has recorded seven solo albums, featuring performances by numerous highly acclaimed musicians. Sherinian enjoys playing in bands with others but uses his solo career to experiment and let his creative side loose.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[The extraordinary bassist and composer Derrick Hodge has an amazing jazz groove and is the winner of the award Rising star - Electric bass by Downbeat. He has worked with some of Philly&#39;s finest and has evolved into a versatile soloist with the impressive debut album &#39;Live Today&#39;. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Derrick Hodge grew up right outside of Philadelphia. He started playing electric bass in elementary school and continued playing in his high school&#39;s jazz band. Hodge&#39;s performance was amazing and his high school band teacher suggested him to continue his formal education at Temple University. He took the advice and so began his jazz journey. 

While majoring in Performance at Temple, Hodge kept himself busy with some of Philly&#39;s finest such as tenor saxophonist Bootsie Barnes and trumpeter Terrell Stafford. As well as reaping considerable session work with modern R&amp;B artists Jill Scott, Musiq Soulchild and Floetry. 
With so much going on focusing on school got difficult so while touring with Scott, Hodge found himself at a crossroad. Either he should go back and finish his school at Temple or he should stay on tour with Scott. He decided to return to Temple to work on his jazz chops and develop his skills further while finishing his education. 

Hodge is probably best known as the anchor of genre-blending, Grammy award winning band the &#39;Robert Glasper Experience&#39;. He has also spent time in the cutting-edge jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard&#39;s group as well as currently being music director for the R&amp;B star Maxwell.

Hodge&#39;s debut album &#39;Live Today&#39; is a showcase of his widely respected versatility and melodic sensitivity. He has created his own unique sound reflecting his experiences working with skilled jazz, R&amp;B, hip-hop, gospel and classical artists. The record is truly honest, transparent and adventurous while featuring guest appearances from rapper Common, singer-guitarist Alan Hampton, RGE members Robert Glasper, vocoderist Casey Benjamin, and drummers Mark Colenburg and Chris Dave among others. The album peaked in the top ten on Billboard charts.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Derrick Lee Murdock (aka Dock) was born in Philadelphia and began playing the bass at 17. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[While this might be considered late in some playing quarters, Dock&#39;s passion for the instrument - driven by a love of the music of Bootsy Collins, Kool, Larry Graham, Geedy Lee, James Jamerson, Stanley Clark and many others - meant that he soon honed his craft to perfection.

In 1994 Derrick left Philadelphia and moved to LA where his skills on the bass were quickly noted and he landed his first high profile role, playing bass with Sheena Easton. He went on to perform and tour with a host of other high profile and talented performers including Tom Scott, Gladys Knight, Natalie Cole, Will Smith, Jim Carey, Bill Cosby, Michael Bolton, Aaron Nevill, Denise Williams, Solomon Burke, Patty Austin, Dr Dre, Rose Royce, BB King, Chuck Berry, Peter Framton, and Huey Lewis. Recently Dock has played with The Jazz Crusaders, The Kevin Eubanks Band and Jeff Lorber

Dock even landed some work in the movies as he performed on one of the soundtracks for the Power Rangers, but his biggest role is arguably as the bass player with The Tonight Show band. Being part of this huge US TV show means that he is seen and heard by millions of people on a daily basis. Dock continues to perform and tour and is a huge fan of RS210, RS212 and RS410 as well as the RH450 of course.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Canadian musician, songwriter and record producer Devin Townsend amazes all with his creativity. He spits out deep and versatile albums en masse and always delivers top quality music. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Devin Townsend began hos musical career by performing in a number of metal bands in high school. He was discovered by a record label in &#39;93 kickstarting his role in the music industry. His discovery led to him performing lead vocals on Steve Val&#39;s album &#39;Sex &amp; Religion&#39; followed by touring with him as well. Townsend was outraged by the music industry and vented his anger on a solo album released under pseudonym &#39;Strapping Young Lad&#39;.  
Townsend assembled a band under the same name and released 4 studio albums until he went solo.

Townsend has an amazing variety in his musical style. He works in ranges of hard rock, progressive metal, new age and ambient. As a solo artist he has had a lineup of various artist working on his albums sporting his infinite variety. 
In 2002 he formed the Devin Townsend band with a dedicated lineup. Under the Devin Townsend band he recorded and toured for two albums. 

In 2007 Townsend needed new scenery. He disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend band and took a break from music for two years. 
When he revisited his music career it was with the founding of the Devin Townsend Project. The project began with a series of four albums each written in a different style and released between 2009-2011. Afterwards he kept to the Devin Townsend Project and keeps releasing under this name. 

Across all Townsend&#39;s bands and projects he has released twenty studio albums and three live ones. Similar in all off these are his versatile vocal delivery that ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing. The same diversity appears in his writing. Townsend&#39;s musical style has roots in metal but draws elements from other genres into the material. Each album is written to express different aspects of his personality. 

Besides being a musician Townsend started HevyDevy records with his wife Tracy almost twenty years ago. Originally the company was founded to distribute his album &#39;Ocean Maschine&#39; but it has grown to be so much more. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Divinity Roxx is the bass player and Musical Director in Beyonc&#233;&#39;s band Suga Mama, an all female group created specifically to accompany Beyonc&#233;. As a solo musician, Roxx is currently working on The Roxx Boxx Experience, her second album due to come out this year.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Before becoming the voracious bass player she is today, Divinity says that it took her a while to discover her musical destiny, stating, &#39;after the clarinet, the chorus and the handbell ensemble in elementary school I found my pulpit rapping and free-styling at the lunch table in high school.&#39; 

Then, after discovering the joys of performance through rap, Divinity added another string to her bow in the form of the bass. &#39;In college I picked up the bass, fell in love with the bass, dropped out of college (like Kanye, but I&#39;m going back someday) and went on tour with the best bass player in the world (bow to Victor Wooten),&#39; she recalls. &#39;I then went on tour with the biggest star in the world (curtsy to Beyonc&#233;). Now I have a million little stories to tell and music is the only way I know how to tell them. You wanna&#39; hear it, here it go!&#39;

Following The Beyonc&#233; Experience tour, Suga Mama became a permanent part of Beyonc&#233;&#39;s team and also toured with her on the &quot;I Am...Sasha Fierce&quot; and &quot;I am ... yours&quot; tours in 2009 and 2010 respectively. On all ocassions, she continued her role as bass player and musical director.
Besides her high-flying career as a supporting artist for the big guns, Divinity also released her solo debut album &#39;Ain&#39;t No Other Way&#39; in 2003. Her next album &#39;The Roxx Boxx Experience&#39; is in the pipelines to hit the stores in 2012, with the single &#39;Bite My Style&#39; already having been released.

Divinity Roxx worked with TC Electronic to create her very own custom-made TonePrints, the &#39;Pretty Gritty&#39; Flanger and &#39;Get Your Fix&#39; Delay. The former is designed to work as an intro, being more aggressive and gritty at the bottom while keeping a pretty little flicker on top. The latter is a bright and rhythmic delay specifically crafted to fit the mold for one of Roxx&#39;s songs, &quot;Get Your Fix&quot;.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Doug Aldrich is one of the world&#39;s true rock stars. Equally adept at playing soaring, heartfelt leads and rocking rhythms, Doug&#39;s versatility and tasty tones make him a force to be reckoned with.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Doug is a Los Angeles-based hard rock guitarist, who&#39;s currently filling the lead guitar slot in the legendary rock band Whitesnake, which he joined in 2003. He also played with legendary heavy metal vocalist Ronnie James Dio and bands such as Lion, Hurricane, House of Lords and Bad Moon Rising. Years ago, Doug was also teaching guitar, and he was very much in demand; at one point, he was teaching a whopping 70 students a week.

Doug&#39;s passion for the six-stringed instrument was forged way back, during his childhood, when he was brought to a Jeff Beck concert by his older sister Jennifer. A year later, at age twelve, after practicing savagely on his younger sister&#39;s classical guitar, Doug received his first ever electric guitar - a Sears copy of a Les Paul guitar.
 
Ever since the publication of the Lion record &#39;Power Love&#39; in 1986, Doug Aldrich has produced a vast amount of recordings, and has featured in an immense set of collaborations with an ever-flourishing palette of world-known artists. This dedicated and highly productive axe wielding gentleman even had time to release three solo albums; &#39;Highcentered&#39; released in 1994, &#39;Electrovision&#39; released in 1997 and &#39;Alter Ego&#39; released in 2001.
 

Doug is using a wide range of guitar models. These range from various classic Les Pauls to Fender Stratocasters and different superstrat models from Jackson Guitars. To power up this thundering arsenal of instruments, Doug is running with a Suhr/Cameron hot-rodded Marshall JMPs and Vintage Modern amps. In his personal closet of roaring effect pedals, we find both the Shaker vibrato that gives a killer vibrating feel and the Flashback Delay that delivers just the right amount of feedback.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Doug Mountain is a sound designer, sound editor and re-recording mixer. Having recorded and mixed audio for film, television and music for over 25 years, he remains one of the world&#39;s leading authorities on digital recording and digital-mixing technologies. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Having served for the last 15 years as sound designer and consulting engineer for the Grammy Awards&#174;, over the years Doug has been involved with a number of award-winning TV and movie productions, such as Breaking Bad, The Mist, Super 8 and Sideways. Since System 6000 was first released, it has been an essential part of his toolbox. 

Describing how System 6000 addressed some problems that the industry had at the time, &#39;TC gave us a box that could contain a 5.1 mix with multiband compression and also a way to contain the sub as well,&#39; he considers. &#39;When you&#39;re re-mixing for film and television, you need to box things in a little bit. The System 6000 lets us do that with a single processor where all the channels are working together. So you knew that when you were boxing in a 5.1 mix, and you were setting certain thresholds and certain limitations, they were being met. In that respect alone, System 6000 did an excellent job.&#39;

The re-recording mixer considers that the Unwrap Algorithm, which turns stereo material into 5.1 Surround, is one of the most important tools to hit the industry in a long time. Because of developments in home-audio systems as a result of the popularity of DVD and Blu-ray media, there was a growing demand for material to be up-mixed from stereo to 5.1. 

&#39;Various techniques had been tried at the time,&#39; he states, &#39;but together with TC&#39;s engineers we came up with various versions of Unwrap - it really made a difference in the industry. It was a cost-effective way of meeting the requirements of the distribution. The Unwrap algorithm would take a Pro Logic mix and unlace it beautifully. It would steer just the right things into the surround, and give you this great unique content. You could even make changes on the fly - it was seamless. So, Unwrap quickly became the standard not only for broadcasting, home video, remixing and distribution, but also for original content such as feature films.&#39;

The next big industry hurdle was mix containment. Over the years, the audio industry had suffered from a loudness problem, where the loudness was pushed more and more to the point where it became uncomfortable to listen to. &#39;We needed to start containing mixes and pulling them back down into a set of standards that was acceptable to everybody,&#39; he says.

Doug describes the new Loudness Radar feature as a groundbreaking and efficient way to measure the average perceived loudness of sound productions. &#39;The radar does an amazing thing - it shows you where the energy level was over a period of time.&#39; he explains. &#39;So you know where to go back in your project and fix the areas that are either too loud or too soft. With the System 6000, the Loudness radar and some of the other tools, it&#39;s really easy to contain a 5.1 mix and meet the specifications that the broadcasters require.

&#39;Now when you listen to TV shows and the commercials kick in, listeners won&#39;t be blasted back, which is really nice. You also feel like your content still has some dynamic range; this box was an integral part of making the transition to these new loudness standards.

&#39;From experience, I&#39;ll tell you that at the final stage of your mix you can rest assured that when it arrives at the consumer&#39;s home, it will sound exactly as you remember it, because the mix translates very well to smaller loudspeakers. The System 6000 is such an integral part of making that happen.&#39;

					<artistBio><![CDATA[One of rock&#39;s true success stories, Duff McKagan&#39;s resume includes larger-than-life bands Guns&#39;n&#39;Roses and Velvet Revolver. He&#39;s an accomplished musician playing virtually anything from drums to bass to guitar, a columnist, a writer and a businessman. Plus he fronts his own band, Loaded.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[McKagan&#39;s story starts way back in his hometown of Seattle during the 70s when he was taught to play bass by his brother Bruce. Playing along to Prince and Black Flag albums, McKagan developed his skills and joined his first band, punk rock group The Vains as a bass player. 

Forging what would become a thundering rock&#39;n&#39;roll career, McKagan played in 31 Seattle rock bands during the 70s and early 80s, including Ten Minute Warning, pop-punk The Fastbacks and hard-core punk band The Fartz as a drummer. In 1983, he headed for L.A. where he met future G N&#39; R mates Slash and Steven Alder and together they formed the short-lived band Road Crew. Before long the three had teamed up with singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin to lay the foundation of one of the biggest rock bands ever: Guns N&#39; Roses. 

Ignited by the success of their Appetite for Destruction album, which sold a whopping 30 million copies worldwide, G N&#39; R embarked on a rock&#39;n&#39;roll odyssey that was to secure them a place in history. Apart from playing bass, McKagan also sang lead vocals on their 1993 punk-inspired album, &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; Right around that time, he kicked off a solo career with &quot;Believe in Me&quot;, an album on which he sang vocals and performed on virtually every instrument. 

As G N&#39; R went on hiatus in 1994, with McKagan officially quitting the group in 1997, Duff found himself getting together with Sex Pistols&#39; Steve Jones, Duran Duran&#39;s John Taylor and ex-G N&#39; R Matt Sorum to form heavy-metal super-group The Neurotic Outsiders. They played the club scene before releasing a self-titled album and going on tour through Europe and South America. The group disbanded in 1997 but McKagan wasn&#39;t short of things to do. He formed Loaded, a hard-rock band that he still plays in, having recently released their third album (2011). 

Early 2000s saw McKagan embarking on a challenging project with ex-G N&#39; R mates Matt Sorum and Slash together with Dave Kushner and Scott Weiland. They called themselves Velvet Revolver and took the world by surprise with their magnetism and energy, releasing two successful albums before dissolving.

Duff McKagan is ultimately a prolific musician having contributed to a myriad of artists&#39; work throughout the years. He has collaborated with Slash for some songs on Iggy Pop&#39;s Brick by Brick album and contributed to Slash&#39; band, The Snakepit. As well as this, he played on former G N&#39; R band mate Izzy Stradlin&#39;s solo albums and tours, on a tribute album to Alice Cooper and worked with Mark Lanegan, Macy Gray and Manic Street Preachers. His latest band &quot;Walking Papers&quot; formed in Seattle in 2012 and features Duff on bass and backing vocals. Before their shows Duff uses the BG250-208 for warm up.

Apart from a long-lasting musical career, this bad boy of rock is a respected columnist for a Seattle newspaper, a writer for Playboy&#39;s financial column, and has received serious critical acclaim when his feverishly anticipated biography hit the stores in 2011. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Dweezil Zappa is the son of Frank Zappa, so it was inevitable that from the moment of his birth, his life would be filled wall-to wall with music (his father having listed his religion as &#39;musician&#39; on Dweezil&#39;s birth certificate). ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Dweezil&#39;s early years were spent largely away from the spotlight, something of a rarity for the child of a celebrity, but perfect for cultivating a close relationship with his family.

Having watched his father perform concerts from the side of the stage since he was in diapers, it was no surprise that he began to show an interest in music early on. At 6 years old, he received his first guitar, a Fender Music Master from his dad.

Having primarily heard the music his father was working on or listening to at home while growing up, Dweezil soon found himself exposed to some new sounds on the radio. Besides his father&#39;s music he began listening to the Beatles, Queen, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Like many aspiring guitarists of his generation, Dweezil&#39;s ear was caught in a stranglehold by the trailblazing guitar styles of Edward Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. 

He listened to their records for hours on end trying to figure out a way to translate what he was hearing in his head to his fingers at the other end of the guitar. Along the way, he had opportunities to ask his dad for some help, but to gain more fundamental knowledge of technique and scales, Dweezil was fortunate to have some assistance from one of the musicians in his father&#39;s band at that time, Steve Vai.

&quot;Steve made a notebook, which I still have, of scales and exercises and I practiced the stuff from that book at least 5 hours a day.&quot; 

Dweezil became remarkably proficient in a very short amount of time due to his intense practicing sessions. In 1982, at the age of 12, he made his first onstage appearance with his father&#39;s band at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. &quot;That was a great experience. I was so excited to have been asked to play, but I was incredibly nervous. Since I could only really play lead in the key of A, Frank devised a hand signal for the band to modulate the song &#39;Stevie&#39;s Spanking&#39; down to A from its original key of B. After I finished my solo, he gave the cue for the band to modulate back up. It was so cool how he had so much control over the music, it almost seemed like a magic trick to me. It made a big impression on me and has stuck with me my whole life.&quot; Later that year, Dweezil recorded his first single, &#39;My Mother Is A Space Cadet&#39;, released on Frank Zappa&#39;s Barking Pumpkin label and produced by non other than Edward Van Halen.

Since 2006, Dweezil has been touring with his father&#39;s music under the name &#39;Zappa Plays Zappa&#39; with an impressive list of band members and guest musicians.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[His surname may mean beautiful in spanish, but when coupled with the common first name Frank, Bello means &quot;certain doom&quot;. His name is synonymous with the heaviest of metal and an anagram for &quot;mean shredder&quot; (don&#180;t check, just trust me on this). Frank Bello undoubtedly is a living bass legend.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Already touring with the New York based group Anthrax as a roadie and guitar technician Frank Bello took a professional quantum leap in 1984 becoming a full-fledged member of the group, replacing Dan Liker on bass. Bello was familiar with the band in more than one sense - his uncle Charlie Benante was the drummer - and quickly became an integrated member of the group. 

A couple of years after Bellos admission Anthrax rocketed towards widespread fame in the mid-to-late 1980s, soon being referred to as one of the &quot;big four&quot; of the thrash metal scene (along Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer) upholding the legacy of former generation heavy rockers such as Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. 
With the release of the now-classic late 1980s albums &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;,  &quot;Among the Living&quot; and &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; the band secured themselves a solid fan base that lives on to this very day, despite their comprehensive exposure to Anthrax. 

Many MTV-viewers - before the channel degenerated into a cluster of nauseating reality shows - will remember Anthrax-singles such as &#39;Antisocial&#39; being in regular rotation on Headbangers Ball. (Some may also recall an epic MTV-contest where a female fan won the questionable prize of Anthrax coming to her house to … well, let&#180;s just say; refurnishing it rock star style!)

With the exception of a brief period of playing with the band &quot;Helmet&quot; Frank Bello has been a permanent member of Anthrax to this very day - the group is still recording, touring and going strong!]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Gail Ann Dorsey is a top session bassist and vocalist with an eclectic and impressive career. She has been associated with being the bassist for David Bowie since 1995 to present day and not least as being a solo recording artist during her incredible career spanning two decades.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[At age 21, Gail Ann Dorsey went to London to pursue her musical career and by the mid-80s she had already made herself known in the London music scene. She proved her abilities through collaborations with other up-coming artists of the day including Boy George, Ann Pigalle, Donny Osmond, and the likes.

Up until present day, Dorsey has made herself a stunning resume. Having performed and recorded with an incredibly diverse collection of distinguished artists including Bryan Ferry, Dar Williams, Tears For Fears, The Indigo Girls, Gwen Stefani, Lenny Kravitz and many more, Dorsey has for long been regarded as one of the top bassists and vocalists within the alternative rock scene. Besides recording and touring with other musicians, Dorsey has also received critical acclaim and notoriety as an international solo recording artist.

In 1988, Dorsey released her first solo album entitled, The Corporate World. The album was produced by world-renowned bassist Nathan East of the multi-platinum selling jazz quartet Fourplay and included appearances by Eric Clapton, amongst others. Her debut album received a 5-Star review and was voted one of the Top 50 Albums of the Year by London&#39;s Q Magazine.

Four years later, after the release of Rude Blue, Dorsey removed herself from the spotlight to concentrate on session work. In 1995, Dorsey was recruited for David Bowie&#180;s Outside Tour with whom she has been related since. 

Aside from her recent tours with David Bowie, Gail Ann Dorsey has just released her third solo album, &#39;I Used To Be&#39;. It contains a collection of previously unreleased material spanning Dorsey&#39;s songwriting archives of the past 18 years. With the exception of a few collaborators, Dorsey pens most of the songs.

Dorsey&#180;s musical style spans broadly and counts rock, funk, country, and pop influences, which can be heard in her playing and in her compositions. When TC Electronic approached Dorsey about creating her own unique TonePrint, she gladly agreed. Dorsey explains that &quot;The better the effect, the more inspiration&quot;, which simply goes to show that the creation of a TonePrint was a perfect opportunity for her to be inspired.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Gary Holt is the talented lead guitarist and songwriter in the American thrash metal band Exodus.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[ary is a dedicated and skilled guitarist, who get&#39;s his inspiration from legends like Ritchie Blackmore, Angus Young and Ted Nugent. We got the chance to have a quick chat with Gary about our guitar gear, which he has been using for some time.

TC: How did you get into music?

Gary: &#39;Like many young kids, I just wanted to do what all my heroes were doing. Play guitar and especially heavy metal. Kirk Hammett is actually the guy who taught me my first chords and brought me into Exodus.&#39;

TC: Which TC products are you using?

Gary: &#39;Right now I&#39;m using a few of the pedals. I&#39;m especially in love with the Vortex Flanger. I used it on a couple of solos when touring with Slayer. I&#39;m waiting to try out the G-System. It is state of the art effects with the added bonus of controlling my stop boxes too. &#39; 

TC: How did you hear about TC&#39;s equipment?

Gary: &#39;I owned a TC parametric EQ pedal for years, I loved that thing. I&#39;ve actually been trying to find another one. Furthermore, I&#39;d always heard how great the rest of the TC gear was and it&#39;s true. Amazing sound quality and bulletproof construction.&#39; 

He continues:
&#39;My rig at the Slayer tour is pretty simple, so I just tweaked the sound to suit my playing and added the TC Flanger to the rig, but as soon as I get home, I will have some free time to experiment with the other gear and get them added to my rack. I&#39;m dying to get more involved with the gear.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[A world class guitar hero, a Grammy-nominated songwriter and composer, an international recording artist with over 20 acclaimed solo albums to date, and a soundtrack composer for film and television, Gary Lucas is on the move in 2013.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Currently, Gary is featured in  &quot;Greetings from Tim Buckley&quot; - a movie which has just hit theatres and is receiving rave reviews. Gary is portrayed by  the Tony winning actor Frank Wood.

Gary started the year with a bang headlining the famed Paradiso in Amsterdam Feb. 17th with &#39;The World of Captain Beefheart&#39;, a gala concert featuring the 60 piece Metropole Orchestra and legendary Nona Hendryx. The show will go out live on producer Co de Kloet&#39;s national Dutch Radio 6 program &#39;Co Live&#39;, and will be filmed for broadcast later this year. In Oct. 2013 Gary is coming to BAM&#39;s new Fisher Space in Brooklyn for two nights with the expanded concert version of his celebrated album of 30&#39;s Chinese pop, &#39;The Edge of Heaven&#39;. Featuring Gary, his band, and two female vocalists from Shanghai, the project received standing ovations in June 2011 at both the 64th Holland Festival in Amsterdam and the Nijmegen MusicMeeting.

Gary just wrapped recording the debut album of his psychedelic dance music project Wild Rumpus with his partner Colleen &#39;Cosmo&#39; Murphy, and their latest 12 inch vinyl single &#39;Cloudhopping&#39; sold-out its first pressing in one week. He recently premiered his new live solo guitar score for Luis Bunuel&#39;s &#39;El Angel Exterminador&#39; at the 33rd Havana Film Festival and rocked the 48th New York Film Festival with the US premiere of his Spanish &#39;Dracula&#39; project performing his original solo guitar score live to accompany a screening of the legendary 1931 film. 

In the last few years, Gary Lucas made successful performing debuts in China, Cuba, the Canary Islands, Colombia, Brazil, Costa Rica and Mexico alongside his usual non-stop touring in Europe and North America, and is coming to BAM&#39;s new Fisher Space in Brooklyn in Oct. 2013 for two nights with the expanded concert version of his celebrated album of 30&#39;s Chinese pop, &#39;The Edge of Heaven&#39;. Featuring Gary, his band, and two female vocalists from Shanghai, the project received standing ovations in June 2011 at both the 64th Holland Festival in Amsterdam and the Nijmegen MusicMeeting. His recent album, &#39;Rishte&#39; (Harmonia Mundi), a blues/raga collaboration with Indian vocalist Najma Akhtar, made #4 on the World Music Charts Europe and the pair garnered a 5 star review in The Financial Times for their live show and an ovation at WOMAD Los Palmas. 

He released his first ever coloured vinyl single &#39;Music for the Eden Project&#39; on 5nakefork Records last year to acclaim which has been used as the soundtrack for UK visual artist Paul McGowan&#39;s installation at the Eden Project in Cornwall. 
 
Gary Lucas tours the world relentlessly both solo and with several different ensembles, including his longtime band Gods and Monsters, whose ranks once included the late singer Jeff Buckley. Gary co-wrote two of Jeff Buckley&#39;s most famous hits, &#39;Grace&#39; and &#39;Mojo Pin&#39;, which opened Jeff&#39;s double platinum Sony album &#39;Grace&#39;, which MOJO magazine named the #1 Modern Classic Rock Album. To date he has released over 20 acclaimed albums in multiple genres, and performed in over 40 countries.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Gary Willis is an American bassist and composer, primarily known as the co-founder of the jazz fusion band Tribal Tech. Aside from his work in Tribal Tech, Willis has risen to fame working with numerous other jazz musicians including Wayne Shorter, Dennis Chambers and Allan Holdsworth.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Through the years, Willis has played with some of the hottest musicians around as well as being the co-leader of Tribal Tech with guitarist Scott Henderson. With Tribal Tech, Willis has released ten critically acclaimed albums while at the same time being massively productive with both his own solo career and countless projects and collaborations. Also in demand as an educator, Gary Willis has conducted clinics and master classes in over 21 different countries and released several books and the popular video &#39;Progressive Bassics&#39;.

Willis, a Texas native, studied arranging and improvisation as part of the legendary jazz program at North Texas State University. It was there that he made the switch to exclusively studying bass after years of studying both guitar and bass. 

After moving to Los Angeles in 1982, he became a course leader at Musicians Institute in Hollywood and taught at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California.

In 2004, Willis became a Barcelona, Spain resident and spends part of his time teaching composition, arranging, improvisation and bass at Barcelona&#39;s prestigious Escola Superior de Musica de Catalunya conservatory. 

Willis launched his solo career with the 1996 release of &#39;No Sweat&#39;, featuring incredible performances by Dennis Chambers on drums, Scott Kinsey on keyboards, and Steve Tavaglione on woodwinds and EWI. The 1998 follow-up &#39;Bent&#39; lives up to its title and takes the &#39;rules&#39; of jazz, through dynamic compositions and rhythm-defying improvisation, and bends reality to fit the talent of easily the most musically monstrous lineup on the scene today. 

The third solo album &#39;Actual Fiction&#39; was released in 2007. Early reviews of &#39;Actual Fiction&#39; describe that it&#39;s &#39;everything you&#39;ve ever liked about his work with Tribal Tech and leaps forward a few light years&#39;, while being &#39;wide open from the very first note and will test your neck vertebrae with the powerful rhythms all through this recording.&#39; 

On his latest solo effort &#39;Retro&#39;, Gary Willis has returned to his jazz roots. His new trio features the incredible Gergo Borlai on drums and the acclaimed Catalan pianist Albert Bover on keyboards. A mix of vintage jazz with the energetic twist that Willis always brings, as well as a melodic side that has been seen in smaller doses throughout his career.

Gary Willis created two super cool and innovative TonePrints for the Hall of Fame Reverb. &#39;The Cloud&#39; is a full on effect that makes for very nice swells, and the &#39;Solo Space&#39; is a great sounding plate reverb that&#39;s perfect for soloing.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Wisconsin guitarist Greg Koch is a master guitarist, who skillfully works through blues, jazz, country, funk. Koch has his hands on music clinics, instructional videos, and plays with various lineups. On top of that, he&#39;s a comedian in disguise.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Growing up influenced by Hendrix from an early age left a lasting impression on Greg Koch: &#39;I started playing guitar when I was twelve years old, and I always wanted to play guitar. I was bewitched by Jimmy Hendrix at a very young age. I was the youngest of seven kids, there were five girls in between, and my brother was the oldest and I was the youngest, so we had a room together, so I actually listened to all of his music growing up. He was heavy into Hendrix, Cream, the James Gang, The Beatles, The Stones…stuff….so Hendrix and Clapton, the Creamier Clapton, these guys were like gods to me when most people were into Kermit the Frog back home.&#39;

Koch studied jazz guitar at the University of Wisconsin, and his Milwaukee-based band Greg Koch &amp; the Tone Controls became one of the Wisconsin&#39;s most popular and acclaimed acts.

Playing in various bands, Koch eventually realized that he wanted to do his own songs. He got signed on Steve Vai&#39;s label, Fender approached him with an offer to do Fender clinics, which would prove to be a match made in heaven due to Koch&#39;s exquisite guitar chops and his unique sense of humor.

Koch has released several popular guitar method books and instructional DVDs for the Hal Leonard Corporation, including one on Koch&#39;s own particular take on guitar called &#39;Guitar Gristle&#39;.

Most recent is Koch&#39;s Strat&#39;s Got Your Tongue release, an instrumental blues-based cd of world-class guitar. We see Greg&#39;s use of the MojoMojo, Hall of Fame Reverb, Flashback Delay pedals, and the PolyTune as a perfect match - Greg Koch and the TC gear both ooze skill and playfulness.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Born into a family of musicians, Hadrien Feraud began studying guitar at age 8, taking lessons from his father. Young Hadrien was actually more interested in playing drums until he received a copy of Jaco Pastorius&#39; The Birthday Concert CD at age 12.

]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[
Naturally, after hearing Jaco, everything changed. Hadrien immersed himself in the study of electric bass, analyzing the techniques of Christian McBride, Victor Bailey, Anthony Jackson, Sk&#250;li Sverrisson, Gary Willis, Matthew Garrison, Richard Bona, Linley Marthe and, or course, Pastorius.

Feraud&#39;s talent as a bass sensation has become widely known throughout the world. Still in his 20s, Feraud has already performed and/or recorded with John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Bir&#233;li Lagr&#232;ne, Flavio Boltro, Jean-Marie Ecay, Mokhtar Samba, Jim Grancamp, Jon Grancamp, Dominique di Piazza, Thierry Eliez, Linley Marthe and many others.

Hadrien has been named &#39;Rising Star, Electric Bassist of the Year&#39; by the Downbeat Critics Polls and &#39;Most Exciting New Player&#39; by Bass Player magazine. FBPO caught up with Hadrien in Los Angeles at Bass Player Live! 2012.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Harry McVeigh lends his unspeakably precise vocals and invigorating guitar skills to British alternative rock band sensation, White Lies.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Formerly known as Fear of Flying, the band also consists of Charles Cave (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Jack Lawrence-Brown (drums) and is accompanied by Tommy Bowen (keyboards) during live performances. 

White Lies formed in October 2007, when the three members realized their songs didn&#39;t fit the confines of their original pop band anymore. It was time for a new start and a darker sound that would reflect their maturity. The band was quite swift in making the change, by briefly announcing &#39;Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!&#39; on their MySpace page. At the time, McVeigh explained that due to the musical climate, they had to change their approach otherwise they would not have been kept by any record company. 

The first contract the newly oriented trio landed was with Fiction Records and not before long their &#39;debut&#39; album, To Lose My Life (2009) beat off competition from Lady Gaga, The Script and Kings of Leon by reaching no. 1 in UK tops. 
Singles like &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; and &quot;Death&quot; with their organ synths and racing guitars led to popularity, tours and festival appearances in the United Kingdom and North America. In addition, the band was headlined at BBC Radio 1&#39;s Big Weekend and got a place on the 2009 NME Awards Tour. Further singles &quot;To Lose My Life&quot; and &quot;Farewell to the Fairground&quot; brought on increased media attention and led to the band&#39;s first worldwide headline tour. Starting with 2009, White Lies featured in multiple &quot;ones to watch&quot; polls for the coming year, including the BBC&#39;s Sound of 2009 poll and the 2009 BRITs Critics&#39; Choice Award.

Regarding White Lies&#39; musical style, the media has drawn comparisons to Joy Division, Editors, Interpol and Echo &amp; The Bunnymen. In response to this, McVeigh declared: &quot;We weren&#39;t alive during that period of music ... we&#39;ve never really been that into Joy Division, especially not the Editors ... or even Interpol really&quot;, adding &quot;I don&#39;t think our music sounds a whole lot like those comparisons, I think we&#39;re a lot more euphoric and uplifting&quot;.

Indeed, their music has been dubbed as dark and brooding; meanwhile, the White Lies insist that their personalities are quite the opposite. &#39;We certainly explore a lot of dark themes but if anything we&#39;re quite grounded, happy, content people. And that&#39;s because we vent our emotions through music&#39;, McVeigh says.

The band has had immense success worldwide and has sold out tickets on each of their tours. They have also participated in numerous festivals among which Lollapalooza, Glastonbury, Roskilde, and Rock Werchter and as of January 2011 have a new album out, called Ritual. 
McVeigh first thought of taking up the guitar while listening to Jimi Hendrix&#39; Voodoo Chile; &#39;Like most guitarists I was inspired by the sound Jimi got out of a guitar. I bought a wah-wah pedal to help me play this but it sounded bad&#39; McVeigh confesses. That was a long time ago and nowadays, Harry has chosen the TC Electronic G-System as his weapon of choice for his effects processing and is using it extensively during the band&#39;s grueling tour schedules.   ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[One third of Swedish band Dirty Loops, Henrik Linder commands his bass with superior skill. Although Dirty Loops are still at an early stage in their career, the 3 guys have been friends since they were little. Things got rolling when they decided to do some fusion covers of pop songs and uploaded them to Youtube. At the moment, Dirty Loops are recording their first album, which will be original songs. Henrik likes to work the six-string bass, but prefers the four-string for slap-bass. Henrik mentions Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers as inspiration for picking up the bass, and cites Gary Willis of Tribal Tech as one of his big favorites.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Ida Nielsen is a fast rising star in the funky bass sky. You may not have heard about her just yet, but chances are that you will, as she just entered the ultimate funk heaven by becoming Prince&#39;s new bass player!]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[In short, she masters any bass style you could think of to perfection: slap, fingerstyle, harmonies, improvisation, etc., and the common denominator is without doubt &#39;funk&#39; with a capital &#39;F&#39;! 


Her bass career started out in &#197;rhus, Denmark, where she developed her slap style to perfection. While she is busy playing in a number of bands, she also has a solo project. In fact, she has recently released a very funky album named &#39;Marmalade&#39;, which has been described as &quot;a mix of old school Hip Hop and 70&#39;s Funk with a touch of Nusoul, all with ear catching melodies and beautiful ballads&quot;. Apart from playing bass - of course - Ida plays all the other instruments on the album. 

Gearwise, Ida normally uses a TC Electronic RH450 amp with two RS210 cabinets, but when playing the major venues and stadiums, she doubles up, using her RH450 to power up two RS410 cabs.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Jack Gibson is the long tenured bass player for celebrated US thrash metal group Exodus. He&#39;s been rocking with the band since 1996 and shows no signs of slowing down. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Cited as a major influence by almost every thrash metal band out there Exodus was formed in 1981 in San Francisco with Kirk Hammett, Tom Hunting, Paul Baloff, Jeff Andrews and Garry Holt as founding members. Known as the &#39;Kings of the Bay Area&#39;, the band had great success on the metal scene despite undergoing many changes in the original line-up and two extended hiatuses. Their first three explosive albums, Bonded by Blood, Pleasures of the Flesh, and Fabulous Disaster sealed Exodus&#39; reputation as one of the most crafty and talented thrash metal bands. 


In 1996, eight albums into the group&#39;s career, Jack Gibson joined the band contributing his dazzling bass tones to the next five outings. The first record they released with Gibson in the band was the 1997 live album Another Lesson in Violence,which was subsequently praised for its exquisite sound, awesome use of instruments and for having a great live feel to it, without a lot of studio tampering. Gibson was appreciated for his smooth bass tone and for being able to easily adapt to the Exodus sound.

Soon after, the band went on their second hiatus only to reform in 2001 for the Thrash of the Titans benefit on behalf of Testament&#39;s Chuck Billy. Their first release after the reunion was 2004&#39;s Tempo of the Damned, immediately followed by Shovel Headed Kill Machine in 2005. Although this period was marked by different changes in the groups&#39; line-up, it was quite a prolific stretch as they toured intensively through the US, Europe, Japan and Australia.

Recently, Exodus has performed as an opening act for Rob Zombie and Slayer&#39;s Hell on Earth tour. In 2012 they will take on South American venues in their quest to teach audiences of the new millennium their unparalleled &#39;lesson in violence&#39;.

Most know Gibson only as the powerful bass player in Exodus, but in fact he has also fathered the bluegrass brainchild, Coffin Hunter - a band that combines Gibson&#39;s love for Nashville music and for playing banjo, giving off a vibe of true Americana like a mix of C.W. McCall, Jerry Reed and Sergio Leone.

Passionate player that he is, Gibson has opted to have TC&#39;s Blacksmith and RS410 in his gear in order to get great quality sound.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Jacob Binzer is the lead guitarist of the Danish hard rock group D-A-D.  For nearly 30 years his country-inspired heavy riffs and sublime soloes have been a key element in the group&#39;s Cow-punk style.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[In Copenhagen in the early 1980s, the band now known as D-A-D surfaced under the name &#39;Disneyland After Dark&#39;. The founding members were Jesper Binzer (vocal, guitar), Stig Pedersen (bass) and Peter Lundholm Jensen (drums). In 1984 Jesper&#39;s younger brother Jacob Binzer was added to the group, bringing with him a set of guitar-skills that instantly elevated the band&#39;s sound to previously unseen heights.

All the way from the early beginning, D-A-D has strived towards making music that is entertaining. Not entertaining in the sense the 1995 album title &#39;Good, clean family entertainment, you can trust&#39; would suggest - but entertaining in the sense the lyrics &#39;wild sisters dancing all night round that totem&#39; would suggest. Their fictionalized (often ironic) lyrics and colorful live performances have made their endeavors highly successful.

The band released its first album, &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; in 1986, but it was not until 1989s &#39;No Fuel Left for the Pilgrims&#39; and the hit-single &#39;Sleeping my day away&#39; that the group got its breakthrough. The album became the band&#39;s greatest success, and secured them a million dollar contract with Warner Music. A certain American cartoon-conglomerate, however, wasn&#39;t too fond of the bands name, and so they had to abbreviate it to D-A-D. Under the new name the band achieved a fair amount of airplay, but in the end they chose to return and focus on the European market. In the late 1990s Laust Sonne replaced Peter Lundholm Jensen on the drums, and since then the lineup has remained the same.

D-A-D is an ever-present act at Danish festivals that wouldn&#39;t be the same without the group. The band has toured all over the world and played thousands of live shows throughout the years. 11 studio albums, 17 singles, a million dollar contract and 10 tribute bands say it all.

Jacob Binzer plays a wide range of different guitars (although mainly Les Pauls) from which he seems to be extracting otherworldly amounts of sustain. Recently added to his pedal board is the TC Electronic Flashback Delay x4. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Jahmal Nichols, bassist, composer, arranger and producer was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. Jahmal is from a rare breed of bassists/musicians that is able to fluently go from electric bass to acoustic bass on any genre of music. His goal ultimately is to bring the world a new sound and voice on the bass and provide great musicianship to any artist that he works for as a sideman. 

He comes from a very musical family and was introduced to the bass at the age of 13 after years of watching his father play bass at church and for numerous of local artists on the R&amp;B scene. Jahmal started his own musical journey at Central Visual &amp; Performing Arts High School and North Carolina Central University, where he majored in music.  It was there at Central Visual &amp; Performing Arts he was introduced to the upright bass and later to the electric bass. From this point on Jahmal intensely worked on perfecting his craft. With 20 years of experience Jahmal has shared the stage with artists from all over the world including Gregory Porter, Fontella Bass, Jon Faddis, Sean Jones, Terrell Stafford, Houston Person, Eric Roberson, Matt Wilson, Anat Cohen, Frank Foster, Julie Dexter, Anthony David, and many many more.... 

Jahmal has recently released his debut album titled &quot;2 Worlds 1 Mind&quot; where he shows his ability to switch from electric and upright bass and also the various tones he gets from the bass.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[James McIlroy is the guitarist of the legendary British extreme metal band Cradle of Filth.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[James joined Cradle of Filth in 2003, where he played on the &#39;Nymphetamine&#39; album as well as appearing on the &#39;Mannequin&#39; and &#39;Peace Through Superior Firepower&#39; DVDs. He then left again in 2005, but returned for the second leg of Cradle of Filth&#39;s 2009 European Godspeed on the Devil&#39;s Thunder tour. Just in time to contribute to the album &#39;Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa&#39;.

When Cradle of Filth is not touring or recording, McIlroy plays in his own bands Chaosanct, Order of Apollyon and NFD. He is currently working on Chaosanct&#39;s debut album as well as new material for all bands.

James first heard about TC through word of mouth. &quot;Literally every guitarist and gear head I knew would be salivating over the TC rack units, and it was just a case of taking the advice of a lot of people who were obsessed with their tone. I then read a lot about effects processors, and without a doubt the #1 company on everyone&#39;s lips was TC Electronics, so I decided to grab myself a G-Major.&quot; 

&quot;For me, the attraction was the transparency, the ease of use, and little things such as worldwide voltage, ability to do external switching and all the nice little extras TC throw in on their products! Once I&#39;d used it, there was no going back, it was an astounding piece of kit, gorgeous effects, easy to program and as a result TC Electronics has been the heart of my effects in every rig I have had for the past decade!&quot;

&quot;I use a TC rack effects processor in the FX loop of my amps in conjunction with midi based amp switchers and loopers. This way I have total control over effects, ordering and amp switching all from one board eliminating the hassle of tap dancing! For me, it just changed the way I thought about gear, I abandoned all processors which were trying to do too much, and it really pushed me down the path of getting as pure an amp tone as possible. With the TC quality I&#39;ve always been completely confident that my amp&#39;s sound is shining through, with the effects being the icing on the cake!&quot;

&quot;I find the TC stuff has lots of little extras. For instance, the G-major I started on had a switch out that allowed me to control jack switchable devices (such as channel switching a head). Other things like easily being able to set input levels, adjust the output, being able to match the input sensitivity to the amp as well as quickly being able to add and edit effects.&quot;

&quot;TC stuff is just easy and simple to use, with a great user interface that is self-explanatory and natural. I&#39;ve never needed a manual to use it, and thus a manual has never gotten between me and my creativity!&quot;

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Commanding bass, shredding twin guitars, hard drumming and aggressive vocals equals hit metal band, Korn. James &#39;Munky&#39; Shaffer is one hard-hitting guitarist that plays the strings in powerful Korn and we are very excited that Shaffer uses our TC gear to spike his sound on- and off stage.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Shaffer started playing guitar at the age of 13, when he injured his left index finger and the doctors suggested that he should do something to rehabilitate his finger. He picked up the guitar. Shaffer started his career in the American metal band L.A.P.D, but after releasing two albums the band decided to pull the plug. This was the beginning of the band, which later became known as Korn. 

Korn was formed in 1993 and their music is categorized as nu metal - a fusion genre that combines heavy metal with other genres like hip hop. When you hear Korn&#39;s tunes you are instantly hit by an overwhelming strength and power, mixed with catchy songs that entertain the listener. In 1996, Korn got their mainstream breakthrough with their second album &#39;Follow the Leader&#39; that peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1998. Korn has sold 16 million albums in the US and over 60 million albums worldwide. But that&#39;s not all: ten of the band&#39;s official releases have peaked the top ten of the Billboard 200 and eight of them were within the top five. Furthermore, they have received two Grammy Awards for hits &#39;Freak on a Leash&#39; and &#39;Here to Stay&#39;. 

Shaffer gets his inspiration from shredding guitarists as Steve Vai, Eddie Van Halen and Randy Rhoads and we are proud that he has selected our gear to be a part of his rig when he plays on major venues around the world.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Maroon 5 lead guitarist James Valentine has come a long way since his upbringing in Lincoln, Nebraska. For more than a decade he has been living the dream writing heartbreak ballades with Maroon 5 front figure Adam Levine, as well as playing some of the funkiest riffs you have ever heard.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[James Valentine began his life on October 5th, 1978. Born into a Mormon family he regularly attended church growing up. He began his musical career on the piano, tried out drums but ended up falling in love with playing guitar.

As a teenager Valentine played in different bands in Lincoln before becoming a member of Square (former known as Happy Dog). He digs jazz and fusion, but for some reason he has always played in rock-oriented bands. 
In 2000 Valentine uprooted and moved to LA, California with his band Square and here he met the members of Kara&#39;s Flowers. Kara&#39;s flowers needed a guitarist and a new beginning and Valentine was the perfect fit. A new beginning equals a new name and Kara&#39;s Flowers became the well-known pop/rock band Maroon 5, with Valentine as lead guitarist and songwriter. 

In 1996 Valentine took a one-week guitar session at Berklee College of Music where he became friends with John Mayer. The two kept in touch and Maroon 5 first got on the radar when they had an opening slot for John Mayer. From there it was fast forward for the band. With their debut album &#39;Songs About Jane&#39; going worldwide and extensively touring they reached a high level of success. With 5 studio albums, 3 live albums, singles and numerous awards, Maroon 5 has established their presence being as cool as they come. 
The band evolves from album to album and finds inspiration from current trends implementing these into their music. They enjoy experimenting with music and styles in order to develop new tunes.                    

Besides providing Maroon 5 with killer riffs Valentine also plays in a band named JJAMZ - Awkward to pronounce but its members are all musical geniuses. The band was started at a karaoke night at Guys in Hollywood. JJAMZ is made up from the first letter of each members name; James Valentine, Jason Boesel (Rilo Kiley/Conor Oberst), Alex Greenwald (Phantom Planet), Michael Runion (solo), and Z Berg (The Like). 

He loves making music and truly has a gift for it.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[London born US based artist, bass player, record producer, author and educator Janek Gwizdala has been on the international music scene for over 15 years. He dropped out early from both The Royal Academy of Music in London and Berklee College of Music in Boston to pursue his own musical journey.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Looking back through Janek&#39;s CV, it&#39;s clear that this is a man who likes to do things his own way. The Royal Academy of Music in London would only take one bass player a year, but that didn&#39;t stop him from quitting after only a year. Janek quickly moved to Berklee College of Music, citing the US&#39;s love of all things Jazz as a pivotal factor. 

Three semesters later Janek would leave for New York, quickly establishing himself on the scene as he racked up experience with such legends as Airto Moreira, Delta Goodrem, Flora Purim, Gary Husband, Jem, Paul Shafer, John Mayer, Jojo Mayer, Mike Stern, Pat Metheny, Marcus Miller, Hiram Bullock, Peter Erskine, Randy Brecker, V. V. Brown and Wayne Krantz. Contacts in New York would also see Janek establish himself as a producer, cutting his teeth with multi-platinum artists Ronny Jordan and Mike Phillips.

As a first class bass player, Janek has toured extensively with some of the best in the business and is a regular on festival circuits. He&#39;s also made regular forays into the musical director&#39;s chair, most notably for platinum-selling Welsh singer/songwriter Jem.

2008 saw Janek&#39;s talents enlisted by Delta Goodrem, one of the biggest selling female artists of all time in Australia, while commitments for 2009 will see Janek working with legendary trumpeter and flugelhornist Randy Brecker as well as touring with his own &#39;Janek Gwizdala Project&#39;.

Janek&#39;s sound benefits from the raw power and clear tone of TC Electronics&#39; bass amps as well as from FlashBack Delay and Vortex Flanger he uses in his rig.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Jared Followill is the bassist in Kings of Leon. In the last decade the group has had tremendous success topping the charts, touring the world and winning several Grammys. Now they are ready to unleash their 6th studio album.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Kings of Leon&#39;s latest album &#39;Mechanical Bull&#39; signifies a return to the group&#39;s earlier sound. It was released in September 2013, and contains the already hugely popular single &#39;Supersoaker&#39;. Jared is responsible for the powerful bass lines that make up the foundation of the group&#39;s southern rock-style. Recently he has added the &#39;Hall of Fame Reverb&#39; to his pedal board.

Seeing how reverbs were Jared&#39;s most used effect type for the recording of &#39;Mechanical Bull&#39;, TC effects are now a key element in Kings of Leon&#39;s live sound. What is more, the BH250 bass amp, Flashback Delay and Flashback x4 are always backstage with Jared before shows.

If you didn&#39;t spend all of 2008 on a deserted island you will know that Kings of Leon is the group behind the hits &quot;Sex on Fire&quot; and &quot;Use Somebody&quot;. If you furthermore enjoy reading band biographies (which if fair to assume you do since you are reading this) you are likely to know that the four members of the group all have the same last name - not due to an unlikely coincidence or a strict band policy, but because they are all related. If you, on top of that, belong to the ever-growing crowd of loyal Kings of Leon-fans, you will know every song the three brothers and their cousin have recorded like the back of your hand.

The Leonese monarchs have undeniably managed to lay the world at their feet in less than a decade. What the future brings for them, no one knows. But it seems certain that the conquering will continue…

After gaining a significant amount of exposure in 2003 in the wake of the &#39;Holy Roller Novocaine EP&#39; the bands debut album, &#39;Youth and Young Manhood&#39;, was highly anticipated - and rightly so. It became a sensation in the UK and Ireland, where NME declared it &quot;one of the best debut albums of the last 10 years&quot;. After cutting their second album &#39;Aha Shake Heartbreak&#39;, the band toured with Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam during 2005 and 2006.

In 2007 the band&#39;s third album &#39;Because of the Times&#39; was released and the single &quot;On Call&quot; became a hit in the UK and Ireland. In 2008, Kings of Leon released their fourth studio album, &#39;Only by the Night&#39;, which went to the top of the UK Albums Chart and reached number four on the US Billboard Charts. The album was the UK&#39;s third-biggest-selling album of 2008 and the biggest-selling album of 2008 in Australia.

2010 was a busy year for the band, playing in more than 50 cities in North America and Europe and releasing their fifth studio album &#39;Come Around Sundown&#39;.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Jason Hook is the lead guitarist of US metal band Five Finger Death Punch.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Jason Hook started his music career at the early age of 6 in Toronto, Ontario, with private guitar lessons. Jason&#39;s early experience in formal music training also included drums, piano and violin. Jason spent many years in Canada honing his craft and he eventually got signed with his band Monkeyhead. Later, Jason relocated to Los Angeles as a session musician as well as a stint in the hard rock band BulletBoys. Hook became a highly coveted session player in the LA circuit, and he went on to tour and recording with acts like the Vince Neil Band and Alice Cooper. In 2007, Hook released his debut instrumental solo album Safety Dunce. It garnered industry praise and an L.A. music award for &quot;Best Instrumental Record&quot; of 2007. Later in 2007, Hook recorded his second solo release American Justice, which featured guest appearances from Alice Cooper, members of Five Finger Death Punch and Phil Demmel from Machine Head. 

In early 2009, it was announced that Hook was joining heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch, replacing guitarist Darrell Roberts. On September 22, 2009, Hook and his new bandmates released the band&#39;s second album, which was certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies in the United States and landed them a number 7 debut on the Billboard Top 200 album chart. 

During March 2010, Jason and Five Finger Death Punch took time out of the busy tour schedule to travel to Iraq and play 10 shows to support the United States troops. 

The band began to record their third studio album entitled American Capitalist in November 2010 at The Hideout studios in Las Vegas, Nevada. The album was released October, 2011 and was produced by Kevin Churko, who also produced the band&#39;s previous album. The album has since been a great success with songs included on video game soundtracks for Madden NFL 12 and Namco Bandai Games&#39; remake of Splatterhouse.

Following the release of the album, they have been touring extensively with impressive line-ups containing bands such as Godsmack, All That Remains, Hatebreed, Soulfly, Windowpane and Persist.

Jason uses a simple setup where he depends on the G-Major 2 for all of his effect needs. The intelligent pitch shifting is one of the important reasons why the G-Major-2 is his weapon of choice. Here is what Jason had to say about it:

It&#39;s really powerful and really smooth. I&#39;ve tried a bunch of units and this is by far the smoothest sounding harmonizer that I&#39;ve found and I&#39;m really exited about it. Thanks TC!

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Joe Perry&#39;s name is synonymous with the raw six-string energy that gives rock phenomenon Aerosmith their trademark edge. The power and craftsmanship of his guitar playing has transfixed fans for over 30 years and placed him in rock&#39;n&#39;roll history.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Like so many guitar virtuosos, Joe Perry first became interested in playing at a very young age. Classic tracks like &#39;Rock Around the Clock&#39; and &#39;Tutti Frutti&#39; marked his childhood, and later legends like The Rolling Stones and The Beatles made their entrance. He picked up the guitar in his teens and started jamming to blues-rockers The Yardbirds and John Mayall. These influences worked their way into his style, leading to the tough and rough blues licks and riffs that would later make Aerosmith famous. 

Some of Perry&#39;s earlier band efforts were with groups like Flash, Just Us and Plastic Glass before getting together with Tom Hamilton to form The Jam Band. Steven Tyler, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer soon joined them and they changed the moniker to &#39;Aerosmith&#39;, just because nobody had a problem with the name. The band stole the &#39;70s music scene with thrusts of metal, glam and cool urban charisma. They combined the blues grit of the Stones and The Yardbirds with the heavy riffing of Led Zeppelin and in no time their tours were sold-out, albums like &#39;Get Your Wings&#39;, &#39;Toys in the Attic&#39; and &#39;Rocks&#39; went gold and platinum and they were off to become one of the world&#39;s biggest rock bands.

The &#39;80s were tougher times for Aerosmith and both Perry and Whitford left the band to pursue solo projects. Perry&#39;s band, The Joe Perry Project, issued an inspired and well-received debut called &#39;Let the Music Do the Talking&#39; followed by &#39;I&#39;ve Got the Rock&#39;n&#39;Rolls Again&#39; in 1981 and &#39;Once a rocker, always a rocker&#39; in 1983. 

1984 saw Aerosmith reunite and the band went on to collaborate with big-name songwriters and producers to launch their long-awaited comeback. What followed was a fruitful collaboration with rappers Run DMC for a remake of Aerosmith&#39;s 1975 hit &#39;Walk This Way&#39; and a string of successful albums including &#39;Pump&#39; and &#39;Get a Grip&#39;. In 1998, Perry helped create the group&#39;s first number one hit single, &#39;I Don&#39;t Want to Miss a Thing&#39;, which was featured on the soundtrack to the box-office success film Armageddon. Aerosmith kept the pace up throughout the 90s and 2000s with their bone-shaking rock riffs releasing acclaimed albums like &#39;Just Push Play&#39; and &#39;Honkin on Bobo&#39;.

Perry also focused on separate projects during the 2000s including his first solo album, &#39;Joe Perry&#39;, a collection of smoldering tunes in which every instrument but the drums is played by Perry himself. The record received universal praise and earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Song (&#39;Mercy&#39;). In 2006, the Joe Perry Project (sporting a new line-up) released &#39;Have Guitar Will Travel&#39;, an album that shows Perry&#39;s own musical tastes and is an exciting mix of influences, from the Doors, modern pop rock, Aerosmith to Fleetwood Mac, proving Perry&#39;s ferocious guitar skills. 

Other solo credits include instrumental music for indie movie &#39;This Thing of Ours&#39;, composing the theme song for the &#39;Spiderman&#39; TV series, lending his guitar skills to Mick Jagger&#39;s &#39;Godess in the Doorway&#39; and playing &#39;Les Paul &amp; Friends&#39;. 

Ultimately, Joe Perry is one of the maverick guitar greats of all time, one of the rock legends who continuously inspire teens to pick up the guitar. His fiery signature sound is unique and TC is happy to be able to contribute to it. Perry has chosen to use our Hall of Fame Reverb and FlashBack Delay pedals, along with our PolyTune and Studio Bundle Complete professional plug-ins to shape his sound. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[The son of a cardiologist, Trohman was raised in South Russell, Ohio before moving to the Chicago area. His family is Jewish, although he noted to JVibe, &quot;I think we were more Jewish culturally than we were religiously because after my brother&#39;s bar mitzvah, we stopped going to synagogue entirely.&quot; Trohman and Pete Wentz attended New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, and the two briefly played together in a band called Arma Angelus. Trohman then met Patrick Stump at a Borders bookstore in Chicago, leading to the formation of the band Fall Out Boy.

Fall Out Boy is an American rock band from Wilmette, Illinois, formed in 2001. The band also consists of vocalist-rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz and drummer Andy Hurley. 

With Pete Wentz as the band&#39;s primary lyricist, and Patrick Stump as the primary composer, Fall Out Boy reached mainstream success with its major label debut, From Under the Cork Tree. Released in 2005, the album won several awards and has achieved double platinum status after selling more than 2.5 million albums in the United States alone.

Joe has been using the TC Electronic &#39;G-Major 2&#39; as his choice for all his guitar effects on their recent tour. When asked what he though of the unit Joe responded &#39;The G-major 2 has all I need and more than I&#39;ll possibly ever need&#39;.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[John 5 is a guitarist that defies regular norms by mastering styles ranging from bluegrass to shred metal. Besides playing for Rob Zombie, he&#39;s collaborated with David Lee Roth and Marilyn Manson and has released several well-received instrumental albums.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Most renowned guitarists are known through their effects and tones but not many are recognizable for their pure individual material. Add to this John 5&#39;s ability to play in any situation, flowing effortlessly from bluegrass to industrial and metal and you&#39;ve got one of the most versatile contemporary guitarists.

John 5, also known as John Lowery, started playing guitar after watching the &#39;Hee Haw&#39; show as a young child. He quickly became immersed in country and bluegrass while at the same time discovering the music of Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, Kiss and The Monkeys. With support from his parents, John 5 played different gigs before moving to L.A. at age 17 to become a session guitarist. 

It was there that he met Whitesnake&#39;s Rudy Sarzo and befriended producer Bob Marlette who both introduced him to other musicians. From 1989 onwards, John 5 worked as a studio musician doing TV show soundtracks, movie soundtracks, commercials and infomercials. This lead to John 5 playing for Lita Ford and opening for long inspirational band, Kiss. In 1996, having missed the audition deadline for Marilyn Manson, John 5 teamed up with ex-Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford to form industrial metal band 2wo, which he played in for two years before finally joining MM as a replacement for Zim Zum. 

Taking the moniker John 5, he embarked for the Mechanical Animals tour and also wrote on the next album, &#39;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&#39;. In 2004, John 5 and MM parted ways and in 2005, while John 5 was working on radio rock band Loser he also began work with cult rock artist, Rob Zombie. John worked on the &#39;Educated Horses&#39; album, co-writing eight out of eleven tracks with Zombie and also did scores for his films &#39;Tyrannosaurus Rex&#39; and &#39;The Lords of Salem&#39;.

Regarding his part in Rob Zombie, John 5 has been known to admit that it is the best band he has ever been in with since he has a lot of freedom with songwriting and the experience is a lot of fun; &#39;It&#39;s the best band I&#39;ve ever been in by far in my whole life. It&#39;s so much fun, I can&#39;t even begin to explain&#39;, John 5 says.

Teaming up with an impressive array of artists throughout his career, John 5 has never limited himself to one style. He strongly believes in constantly broadening his musical horizons and acknowledges that different music styles all have something to offer. This particular view on music imprints/ lays… on the way he develops his solo music, being quite evident in his albums. He has released six successful instrumental albums so far and all are neat hybrids of country, progressive bluegrass, metal and hard rock - a genre he likes to call &#39;blackgrass&#39;. Among talented artists guesting on his records are Albert Lee, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Jim Root contributing to the already explosive energy that John 5&#39;s dazzling technique exudes. 

As a master of styles ranging from country to shred metal, John 5&#39;s gear must live up to the extreme demands of his performance. Consequently, he has opted to use TC&#39;s Flashback Delay and MojoMojo pedals to configure his fenomenal guitar sound which is always nothing short of an intense and enjoyable ride.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[John Garrison is the multi-instrumentalist responsible for singer-songwriter sensation, James Blunt&#39;s, rich bass tones. He has become a touring nomad and is a recent TC RH750 and RS410 convert.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[John Garrison&#39;s life-long passion for music started off on the piano at the age of three before progressing and settling on the bass, although not before proving his versatility on the guitar, drums and with vocals first. Garrison kick started his musical career straight after school and had an extensive career performing both as a part of, the now defunct post-grunge rock band, &#39;Budapest&#39; as well as a solo guitar artist and session artist. 

His big break into the spotlight came around in 2007 as a result of James Blunt&#39;s bass player&#39;s departure from the band. Garrison was contacted by Blunt&#39;s drummer, Karl Brazil, to audition for the band and hasn&#39;t looked back since.

Garrison believes that it is all about the song as he considers himself a songwriter&#39;s bassist. He says that if someone goes away from a concert saying, &#39;the bass player was amazing&#39;, then he feels he has been too busy. 

As a source of inspiration, he draws on his favorite band growing up, &#39;Jellyfish&#39;, and their bass player Tim Smith. He has also been greatly influenced by funk, just as many other bass players have been.

A friend of Garrison&#39;s recommended TC Electronic&#39;s bass amp and he first got around to trying it at a party in Copenhagen. He was immediately sold by the quality and had to get one for himself. Nowadays, he brings along two TC Electronic RH750&#39;s and RS410&#39;s on tour with James Blunt. Before switching to TC Electronic amps, Garrison experienced ghost notes when performing on big stages and had to counter the problem by playing certain notes lower or EQ&#39;ing them out. He did this so that his false notes wouldn&#39;t throw any of the others off their tune. Luckily, that problem is a thing of the past for him, as he says &#39;I hardly have to touch it. I just plug it in, turn it up and it sounds like I want it to sound&#39;.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a prolific session musician in the 1960s, he played and recorded with artists including Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones, The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart and Cat Stevens. He was a founding member of Led Zeppelin. Following his career with Led Zeppelin, he worked as a performer, arranger and producer for artists and groups including Diamada Galas, REM, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel and La Fura dels Baus. He released his debut solo album, Zooma, in 1999, followed by The Thunderthief (2001).

Since 2004, projects have included John Cage&#39;s Music Circus at the Barbican under the direction of Stephen Montague, touring with bluegrass trio Nickel Creek, and working as co-composer and performer for Merce Cunningham&#39;s Nearly Ninety. In 2009 he co-founded the band Them Crooked Vultures with Dave Grohl and Josh Homme. They have released a universally acclaimed album and toured worldwide to sold-out venues.

John has recently been performing with Seasick Steve at festivals across Europe, as well as collaborating with Norwegian avant-garde improvisers Supersilent which has led him to form a new project with Helge Sten (Supersilent) called Minibus Pimps. Using electronics, samplers, processors, instruments and ipads, the duo will be creating instrumental improvisations that will at times be ferocious and at other times intricate, their debut performance will be at Punkt Festival in Norway.

John is currently writing an opera, collaborating with acclaimed director Gerald Thomas.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[John Petrucci is one of the most technically gifted guitar players in the world and, as one of the founders of Dream Theater, has enjoyed enormous critical and commercial success selling around 8 million albums worldwide. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[With a career spanning over two decades, the band has produced 10 albums and toured the world, becoming well known for their intense and spectacular instrumental skills and often playing mammoth three hour sets that vary hugely from night to night. With incredibly complex arrangements often gliding over odd time signatures throughout and fast unison lines between John and keyboard player Jordan Rudess and the other musicians on stage, these gigs have become occasions for fans to admire musicians at the peak of their game. 

And because Dream Theater is very much a musician&#39;s band, with each member demonstrating playing of the utmost skill and passion, it&#39;s no surprise that Petrucci has been regularly voted Guitarist Of The Year (most recently in Total Guitar magazine). His incredible technique and alternate picking style have also earned him invites into the upper echelons of the guitar-playing world. G3 is Joe Satriani&#39;s touring concept where he invites two of the best guitarists in the world to tour with him. With half a dozen of these tours under his belt, Petrucci has now been invited on G3 more than any other player. 


Petrucci has a huge international fan base among hardcore guitar players and rock fans and he is often cited as one of the top 5 &#39;shredders&#39; in the world. That being said, when asked in a recent interview with TC about the one piece of advice he would give to an up-coming guitarist, his answer was not about technique but simply to &quot;be creative&quot;. 

It&#39;s no surprise that there are even forums and websites dedicated to John, the gear he uses and how he gets his unique sound with lists showing which gear was used on each of the Dream Theater albums and Petrucci&#39;s solo output. While his sound is very much about his unique playing style, Petrucci also takes a great amount of interest in his gear - naturally, he only uses the very best guitars and effects to polish off his sound.

With his own signature guitar series, it&#39;s down to TC Electronic to provide him with much of the effects and pedal power that he needs. Included in his arsenal is a TC Electronic SCF pedal, a 1210, three M3000&#39;s and a C400XL.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[This virtuously talented jazz-rock guitar player and composer holds a staggering potpourri of musical accomplishments. He has worked with the cr&#232;me de la cr&#232;me of well-known artists, and reigns the world of both bebop, jazz fusion, funk, blues, soul, rock and many other forms of modern music.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Scofield&#39;s interest in music initially began when his family moved to the small suburban locations of Wilton, Connecticut. He attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, and when he eventually left school he started recording with Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan. In 1976, after two years of performing and recording with the Billy Cobham/George Duke band, he replaced Pat Matheny in Gary Burton&#39;s quartet. In autumn 1976, he signed a contract with Enja Records and released his first album, &#39;John Scofield&#39;, in 1977 - the first of many records to come.

Ever since the beginning of his musical journey, Scofield has been collaborating with legendary musicians such as Miles Davis, Dave Liebman, Joe Henderson, Charles Mingus, Joe Defrancesco, Herbie Hancock, Pat Matheny, Bill Frisell, Pat Martino, Mavis Staples, Phil Lesh, Billy Cobham, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, George Duke, Jaco Pastorius, John Mayer and many more. He has been leading his own groups in the international jazz scene as well, and his discography holds a vast repertoire of over 30 different albums.

Touring approximately 200 days a year, John is armed with a very specific weaponry of instruments. Whether recording or performing live on stage, John always brings his personal rack of Ibanez guitars. He is an endorser of Ibanez, and he even based the Ibanez signature model, the JSM100, on his life-long brother in arms, the 1981 Ibanez AS200, which he believes to be one of the best semi-acoustics ever built.

John runs his guitars into a Pro Co RAT through Vox AC30 with top boost, and his arsenal of effect-stomp-boxes includes the awesome Hall of Fame Reverb TonePrint pedal from TC. Furthermore, he relies on the very cool TC PolyTune to always keep his guitars armed and ready.]]></artistBio2>

Before taking the leap as a solo artist, Johnny worked as a &#39;side-man&#39; for artists such as Doug Clifford from CCR, Mingo Lewis from McGlaughlin Santana, Bobby Whitlock from Derek and The Dominos and Peter Wolf from the J. Geils Band. In 1999 Johnny began his successful solo career, which is still going strong.

When asked about his musical inspirations, Johnny pays a lot of respect and credit to such legendary artists as Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Chet Atkins, Les Paul, Pat Martino, The Everly Brothers, and of course the before mentioned The Beatles and The Stones.

When it comes to guitar effects, Johnny is an avid user of the G-System, and was actually one of the original beta testers of the system during its development. When asked how he prefers to use the G-system, Johnny answered: &#39;I&#39;m using it inline as a floor device, not as a convertible device. I like gear that&#39;s part of a solution and not part of a problem. It&#39;s a great solution to a lot of problems. The fact that it&#39;s a switching system, a multi-effects processor as well as having loops where you can put in your favorite gain pedals is a Godsend. It has simplified my life immensely by using it!&#39;

The main reasons why he likes the G-system so much is the great programming and switching options, which lets him jump seamlessly between different multi-layered effect setups, or even lets him do a 180 degree turn in style and effects if he wants, and all of this is possible just by pressing a single button.

Johnny A&#39;s effect philosophy is that the best effects are the ones you don&#39;t even notice are there, and this makes TC effects and the G-system the obvious choice for him, because as he puts it: &#39;TC products are very clean, very transparent. The way that they route within this box allows you to have a very, very non-muddied path so it keeps the source material intelligent.&#39;

Johnny A is currently working on his next solo album, which is set for release in early 2013.]]></artistBio2>

Bass					</artistSegment>
					<artistBio><![CDATA[Jon Thorne has grown a highly respected reputation for his innovative approach and style on the double bass. He took an instrument that is typically rooted in a more contemporary and classical genre of music and interpreted it into Lamb&#39;s experimental electronic sound with great success.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Having started his musical career quite late, only picking up and teaching himself the bass at the age of 23, Thorne quickly progressed and made up for lost time by developing his skills and learning more as he gigged. He is now renowned as a passionate, energetic and highly skilled performer and his career as a double bassist and composer has spanned a broad range of the musical spectrum.

As double bassist in the acclaimed groundbreaking electronica band Lamb, he has virtually pioneered the use of live double bass playing in electronic music. Since the group&#39;s debut in 1996 he has recorded on five of their albums, toured thirty five countries in five continents and played at most of the world&#39;s leading festivals including Coachella, Roskilde, Werchter, Glastonbury, Montreux Jazz, North Sea Jazz and NYC Central Park SummerStage.

He has also recorded, performed and appeared on albums alongside artists as diverse as Robert Miles, Trilok Gurtu, Robert Fripp, Donovon, Gilad Atzmon, John Smith, Lou Rhodes, James Yorkston, Love Amongst Ruin, King Creosote, Sam Carter, Amos Lee, The Memory Band, Mr Scruff, The Accidental, Jesca Hoop and Martha Tilston.

Besides his influential contribution to Lamb, he also leads the ensemble &#39;Oedipus Mingus&#39;, an octet that performs original arrangements of the music of Charles Mingus, an American jazz extraodinaire known for his sublime arrangements. 

His debut album &#39;Manchester Road&#39; was released through SAM LTD/EGEA records in 2006 and consisted of 12 original jazz compositions with pianist Steve Brown and drummer Luke Flowers. In 2010, he followed up on &#39;Manchester Road&#39; by writing, recording and producing his second album &#39;Watching the Well&#39; on the Naim label; an album which went on to receive strong critical acclaim. This album was both written for and featuring his mentor, the legendary British bassist Danny Thompson.

Thorne has been very happy with his hard-hitting TC Electronic setup consisting of the BH500 and RS410. During our TonePrint session together he did get to test-drive the powerful RH750 head, about which he jokingly said &#39;you could do some serious damage to somebody, if you really wanted to.&#39;

Following our TonePrint session, we are proud to hear that Thorne intends to use his creations and the TonePrint enabled pedals, in particular the Corona Chorus, as a part of his primary sound, all the time, from now on.]]></artistBio2>

								<youtubeDescription><![CDATA[Named after Jon&#39;s wife, Joanna, this TonePrint for the Corona Chorus is a rich and enhancing chorus tone aimed to beef up his basic sound. Despite its richness, it is still a rather subtle and slow chorus, which Jon feels would work great in combination with some reverb and distortion. As a result of the deeper tones, a unique snaring sound appears up top to add even more flavor to the sound.]]></youtubeDescription>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[J&#243;n &quot;J&#243;nsi&quot; &#222;&#243;r Birgisson is an exceptional musician, whose signature move is playing guitar with a cello bow. Often praised as an otherworldly angel, J&#243;nsi in fact does strike a lot like one because of his angelic falsetto voice.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[J&#243;nsi is the front man of the Icelandic post rock band Sigur R&#243;s whose music has achieved a jaw dropping success. Normally bands that sing in their own mother tongue have less chance of becoming known all around the world - Sigur R&#243;s breaks that rule. Their gibberish sounding lyrics and soul grabbing, esthetic music has earned them a well deserved success.

Sigur R&#243;s didn&#39;t receive much attention until after 1999&#39;s &#193;g&#230;tis byrjun. A British journalist described the album &#39;like God weeping tears of gold in heaven.&#39; In 2002 the band released an untitled album in Hopelandic language (aka. glossolalia), that basically had no meaning and lyrics were not to be found anywhere. The idea behind was to make people interpret the music and sounds in their own way, write their own lyrics.

J&#243;nsi has been involved in many music projects since the creation of Sigur R&#243;s in 1992. 7 albums on his hand, collaborations with the movie industry resulting in several movie soundtracks, collaborations with his long term boyfriend Alex, as well as solo performances.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Josh Rand started out as a bass player but it wasn&#39;t until he picked up guitar that he found his true bliss. Ever since 2000 he has been rocking in the band Stone Sour adding his passion of thrash metal to the group&#39;s sound.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Apart from being an excellent guitarist Josh Rand is a talented songwriter. Experimenting with different effects is a catalyst for his writing and TC pedals are his go-to effects for spitting out killer songs. His first acquaintance with TC pedals was an article in Guitar World and he soon bought a bunch of them from Sweetwater. Rand is most thrilled about the TonePrint technology. The mind-blowing ability to fine-tune his settings or to beam someone else&#39;s without any trouble is a feature he couldn&#39;t find elsewhere.

Rand is born in Iowa on the south side of Des Moines. He began playing bass guitar when he was 15, the same year he met Corey Taylor (vocalist in slipknot and founder of Stone Sour) whom he later rocked with. Billy Sheehan, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted have been great inspirations to Josh. 
After two years of playing bass guitar he switched to guitar and found this to be his true calling. He earned a professional certificate in guitar from Berklee College of Music and is currently pursuing a master&#39;s certificate. 

In 2000 Josh crossed paths with Corey Taylor and restored the hard rock band Stone Sour - named after a drink consisting of whiskey and orange juice. The restored Stone Sour came out with their first album in 2002 including the song &#39;Bother&#39; which featured in the Spider-Man soundtrack. This album was RIAA certified with gold. Although Stone Sour&#39;s musical style reflects hard rock, Rand tries to implement an aspect of metal and thrash metal elements into the music. His passion for trash metal goes way back to his early days. Since then Stone Sour has released 5 albums with more than 5 million records sold worldwide. On top of that they have earned 3 Grammy nominations and other awards. Rumor has it that Stone Sour will release a cover EP in 2015. 

In 2013 Josh Rand released the DVD &#39;The sound and the story&#39;, an instructional DVD taking the viewer behind the scenes of Josh Rand himself. The DVD consists of an exciting story about Rand and his music filled with guitar content, lessons, exercises, interviews, gear tours and much more.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Juan Alderete is an American bassist known for his work with the bands Racer X and The Mars Volta. He is famous for his copious use of effects, and his wide-ranging playing techniques. These skills have allowed him to play a variety of musical styles, from jazz, to heavy metal and progressive rock.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Juan Alderete, born John Peter Alderete, started to play music at an early age. Through his father and brother he was exposed to jazz music and bands like Yes, Rush and King Crimson including Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke. Alderete while still being in his teens, quickly picked up the techniques of these influencers. 

At Musicians Institute in L.A California, where Alderete enrolled after finishing high school, he hooked up with Paul Gilbert and Harry Gschoesser to form the speed metal band Racer X. The band split up after four years of playing, and for the next couple of years Alderete was involved in several different bands, including The Scream, DC-10, Big Sir, and Distortion Felix. In addition Alderete became an instructor at Musicians Institute where he started as a student.

In 1999, Alderete reunited with Racer X going on to record another album Technical Difficulties. It included new as well as older songs never released before.

A few years later, after receiving a phone call from The Mars Volta&#180;s Omar Rodr&#237;guez-L&#243;pez, Alderete got invited for an audition for the band and eventually got the job.

Apart from being involved with The Mars Volta with whom he won a Grammy Award for their song Wax Simulacra, Alderete has been involved with his own musical projects, Vato Negro and Big Sir. Vato Negro is a group with a revolving door of musicians, including Deantoni Parks, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, and Jon Theodore. Big Sir is a group composed of Juan and singer Lisa Papineau. The band has released two albums, and are currently recording a third. Alderete has performed with both groups in 2010 in California and Fuji Rock Festival in Japan.

Alderete usually plays Fender Precision basses and uses loads of different bass effects and gear. He collaborated with us to do a TonePrint for Shaker Vibrato called Vato Vibrato.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Justin Meldal-Johnsen&#39;s highly sought after skills and musical interpretation has equated to an illustrious career that has seen him contribute to the arts as a bass performer, producer, songwriter and musical director for artists as diverse as Beck, Nine Inch Nails and Tori Amos.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Having received his first bass at the age of twelve, Justin diligently learnt to play by accompanying the videos that were played on MTV, followed by 45&#39;s and LP&#39;s that he bought or scavenged from his parents&#39; collection. During the 80s, his musical spectrum broadened rapidly through the emerging musical frontiers that included alternative rock, punk and experimental music. 

Throughout the late 80s and early 90s Justin was very active across genres, recording and touring with bands such as The Elastic Purejoy and Medicine. In 1996 Justin&#39;s career really started to take off when he took over bass duties in Beck&#39;s band.

Over the years to come, Justin&#39;s adventure with Beck broadened and included recording the albums &#39;Mutations&#39;, &#39;Midnight Vultures&#39;, &quot;The Information&quot;, &quot;Guero&quot;, &#39;Sea Change&#39; and most recently &quot;Morning Phase&quot;, doing several world tours, making videos, TV appearances, as well as later on becoming his live show musical director. 

Justin&#39;s contributions to the albums earned Beck and the band critical acclaim and a number of Grammy Award nominations, including the award for Best Alternative Music Performance in 2000 for &#39;Mutations&#39;. The success of &#39;Sea Change&#39; also led to Rolling Stone adding the album to their &#39;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&#39; list.

Justin has also been the touring guitarist for two Nine Inch Nails tours in 2008 and 2009. Other notable contributions and projects have included collaborations with artists such as Tori Amos, Air, Gnarls Barkley, Black Eyed Peas, Dido, Garbage, Ladytron, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Nelly Furtado, Blood Orange, Goldfrapp and The Mars Volta in the form of bassist, producer, or songwriter. Recently, he has also moved into the world of film scores, with contributions to movies such as &#39;Team America: World Police&#39;, &#39;Charlie&#39;s Angels&#39; and Starsky and Hutch&#39;.

Nowadays a lot of Justin&#39;s work takes place in the producer&#39;s chair where his keen ear for sound has resulted in the recordings of phenomenal records by the likes of M83, Paramore, Neon Trees, The Naked And Famous, Young The Giant, Tegan &amp; Sara, School of Seven Bells and The Raveonettes.

As a self-proclaimed &#39;sound design effects freak&#39;, the TonePrint collaboration between TC and Justin turned out to be a hit, which spawned &#39;Bass Nostalgia&#39; for the Corona Chorus and &#39;Justin&#39;s Delay&#39; for the Flashback Delay.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Kay plays bass for In Extremo, a metal band that combines heavy riffs with medieval influences.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Kay Lutter was about 9 years old when he picked up his first bass guitar. After 8 years on a music school in his hometown Potsdam, he moved to Berlin to study music on the Hanns Eisler Highschool. Kay Lutter played in a wide range of different bands, before he found his place in In Extremo in 1997.

As a band In Extremo rose to fame as being a solid metal band that does not shy away from adding unorthodox sounds to their songs and they draw heavily on instruments such as bagpipes, harp, hurdy-gurdy and shawm, creating a pagan medieval vibe. Their repertoire holds a variety of well-known traditional ballads. However, during the past few years the members of In Extremo have been expanding their musical palette with their own material written in German.

We had a chat with Kay Lutter about his experience with the Blacksmith from TC. Needless to say being on tour takes its toll on even the toughest gear. Kay recalls complications associated with the somewhat fragile nature of tubes and the handling of tube amps on tour: &#39;I&#39;ll be honest to you. I was looking for a loud amp that is easy to handle. I hated to have broken tubes after the second concert during a festival tour and to end the tour with a rental amp. You know what I mean?&#39;. The development in the field of transistor based amps during the past years has made Kay Lutter reconsider his attitudes towards amplifiers: &#39;I decided to change from tube to transistor - and I&#39;ve never regretted this step&#39;.

While on tour Kay Lutter uses 3 different bass guitars, all with different output levels. He specifically emphasizes the easy handling of the Blacksmith being one of its main qualities: &#39;I really like the sound of the Blacksmith, but actually it&#39;s the handling that makes me happy. If you play on a big festival and you only have 25 minutes for a soundcheck with a band with 7 members and maybe 15 different instruments you&#39;ll be happy to have a reliable amp on stage. That&#39;s the most important thing for me...&#39;.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Ken Hahn, co-owner of New York&#39;s Sync Sound is one of the best-known names in both the post-production and music world. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Ken has 25 years of experience in audio post-production and has received two Cinema Audio Society Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing Awards, five Emmy Awards, 13 ITS Monitor Awards, a Mix Magazine TEC Award for Best Audio Post Production Mixer and has engineered several Grammy Award winning albums. 

Ken is the co-owner and Supervising editor on projects for TV, film and DVD of New York&#39;s Sync Sound Inc. - a complex consisting of four mixing studios, six Sound Design rooms and a feature facility called Digital Cinema, LLC. Ken specializes in mixing for television, film, home video, CD and DVD, in Stereo, Dolby Surround and 5.1. Working with high-profile clients that demand excellence as well as speed, Hahn is understandably picky when it comes to the equipment he uses. 

We had a talk with Ken about his use of System 6000:

&#39;I got into mixing on digital consoles early on and was in search of outboard processors to keep the audio in the digital realm. TC Electronic was the first and, at that time, only company to do it to my satisfaction. I started by using the Finalizer and M5OOO, eventually migrating to System 6000 MKII. &#39;

&#39;I now work completely in Pro Tools, utilizing a D-Control console. Therefore, I moved many of the processors that I came to rely on from the TC Electronic System 6000 MKII to plug-ins for Pro Tools. For instance I use plug-in versions of UnWrap HD and VSS3 reverb.&#39;

&#39;The sole surviving &#39;outboard&#39; piece of gear that I use is the TC Electronic System 6000 MKII. It has capabilities that no other processor has. For instance, the System 6000 MKII still has the BEST pitch shifting available. Especially for 5.1 and 7.1 processing.&#39;

&#39;When television went 5.1, there was a void of 5.1 processors. The only real exception was System 6000 MKII. It had all the features that I needed to work in 5.1. It had 5.1 dynamics and EQ, great reverbs and delays and eventually the UnWrap HD program.&#39;

Ken explains that the BackDrop algorithm (the noise reduction plug-in for the 6000 MKII) has been a real hit at Sync Sound: &#39;It takes out everything from air conditioning to buzz and hum, and it&#39;s really very impressive.

Hahn is also a fan of System 6000 MKII&#39;s multi-channel compression algorithm. &quot;They really have thought of a lot of things when designing it, things like which channels should be linked, which ones shouldn&#39;t, which pairs should be linked, should the rears be linked to the front so they all compress together or not? Those are the kinds of tools that you want to have. TC Electronic has clearly gotten input from people who really have an understanding of this. 


&#39;Every TC Electronic product that I have ever used has been intuitive to operate, and yet at the same time, remarkably flexible in enabling the user to adjust nearly every conceivable parameter. These products are designed by people who are users and who therefore know what users want.&#39;

&#39;System 6000 MKII remains the most powerful digital audio processor available. From dynamics, to EQ and UnWrap HD, it is the &#39;no compromise&#39; audio tool.&#39;

					<artistBio><![CDATA[KenKen is an incredible bass player, belonging to one of Japan&#39;s most iconic 3 piece rock bands RIZE.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[His musical journey started at the age of 8 when he started learning to play the bass, drums and other instruments, but it was the bass that fascinated him the most. KenKen developed his own unique style of playing by listening to a variety of musical genres from punk, rock and funk to jazz and other styles.
He is critically acclaimed as one of the best bass players in Japan through a wide array of works with popular rock bands such as Dragon Ash, WAGDUG FUTURISTIC UNITY, the Day, and others that allowed him to utilize his flexible and versatile musical styles ranging from aggressive slap bass to more subdued and melodic techniques. His stage performance is often said to be just like &quot;Flea&quot; of Red Hot Chili Peppers, which makes total sense, as Flea has been a huge inspiration to KenKen. For instance, KenKen has practiced the slap bass style at double speed, compared to Flea&#39;s original performances.
Apart from being an amazing bass player, KenKen is also a professional gamer, having appeared on Sony PSP TV Commercials, as well as having a special column in a popular game magazine.

A mere glance at Kern Brantley&#39;s credits reveal an individual whose talent and reputation for excellence earns numerous placements on major projects. Through his experience Kern has become a very accomplished Musician, Producer, Songwriter and Arranger.

Kern was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan; a city that is synonymous with music heavyweights, Kern gleaned his style listening to the celebrated Motown artists of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s. Kern recalls watching many of these musicians perform locally and credits this intimate access as being the initial catalyst for his fascination with this industry. One of his earliest childhood experiences was observing a young music phenom by the name of Stevie. 

There is no doubt that being raised in Detroit during this period was electrifying and influenced his style a great deal. But what few people realize is how unbelievably competitive it was to be an artist of any kind during this era. The standards were set very high. Musicians who were developed during this period possess an understanding and appreciation for the art of music making that cannot be learned or manufactured. Kern epitomizes this awareness.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[To most guitarists Kirk Hammett needs no introduction whatsoever. To everyone else he has been the lead guitarist, songwriter and one of the driving forces behind heavy metal Hall of Famers Metallica since 1983.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Although Hammett is best known for his axe-wielding inferno for Metallica over the past 28 years, it should also be noted that he is an influential and founding member of thrash metal band Exodus, with whom he rocked for three years. In fact, Exodus opened for Metallica in late &#39;82 and &#39;83, making a move to Metallica seem like it was destined to happen for Hammett. 

Over the years he has added numerous awards and recognitions to his name, which have included personal awards such as being included in Rolling Stone&#39;s &#39;The Top 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&#39;.

As far as achievements go with Metallica, Hammett has contributed to 9 studio albums, three live albums, five extended plays and 45 singles. The band can also boast nine Grammy Awards (out of 18 nominations), and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the first band to do so. Adding to all of this, he helped Metallica propel themselves out of the underground scene and into the spotlight of heavy metal. To date, Metallica has sold more than 100 million records featuring classics such as &#39;Enter Sandman&#39;, &#39;One&#39; and &#39;Nothing Else Matters&#39;.

Beyond their commercial success, Metallica and Hammett have become an inspiration for countless musicians extending beyond their own heavy/thrash metal genre - for example, the four cellists who make up Apocalyptica. Metallica has been said to be responsible for re-shaping and injecting a much-needed boost of energy to heavy metal.

Hammett has an extensive collection of guitars, but is especially known for his long-time love affair with ESP guitars - a mutual love which has spawned several Kirk Hammett signature models, mostly centered around a super-strat design. 

Kirk&#39;s been using TC Electronic gear since the old days as well, choosing the precise tonal shaping options of the TC Electronic Dual Parametric Equalizer to achieve his crushing tone. Not only did Hammett use the Dual Parametric Equalizer live during the early days, it was a staple of his tone during the recording of the 1984 classic Ride The Lightning album, shaping the famous lead sounds on the album that cemented Metallica as leaders of the thrash movement.

Kirk Hammett is definitely a musician who uses a wide array of effects although he prefers a rack setup that is controlled sidestage by his guitar tech. This is where we can proudly say that he had the TC Electronic G-Major as part of his rack setup for a number of years. This road-worthy workhorse has since been replaced by the upgraded and refined G-Major 2, released in 2009.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Knox Chandler is a New York based guitarist and cellist. He is known as a session musician but his musical career has spun widely including touring recording, arranging and producing several known for three decades.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Chandler got interested in music and arts at an early age and hearing Stravinsky for the first time as a child inspired his musical talent. Later on, hearing the Beatles on the radio while living in England in the early 60&#39;s, boosted his interest in music.

Chandler&#180;s biggest influence early on was Jimi Hendrix. What struck Chandler most was not Hendrix &#180;playing but the sounds he was able to create, especially the sounds heard on Third Stone From The Sun, EXP and the whole third side of Electric Ladyland.

In Bard College, where Chandler joined the AMDDFP (Art, Music, Drama, Dance, Film and Photography) division his interest in experimenting with music together with his humble personality shined through. Chandler quickly got acquainted and collaborated with inspiring people ranging from local artists to visiting professors on campus. After graduating from Bard, Chandler was already a known musician.

As a solo artist, Chandler has worked with acts such as Depeche Mode, Lori Carson, The Golden Palominos, The Psychedelic Furs, Grace Jones, Budgie and R.E.M on their album Automatic for the People. Chandler has also collaborated with Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode on his solo album Paper Monster. In addition, he has also recorded on two Cindi Lauper albums while working with her throughout a decade. Recent shows with Xpatsys (Robert Longo), J.G.Thirwell, Butterfly Percusion Parade (Budgie) and his long term association with Siouxie and the Banshees, The Creatures and Siouxie and the Dreamshow speak for themselves. 

For the time being Chandler will continue to perform around NYC. He performs these shows where he plays live to videos he has created. Chandler processes video with the same aesthetic as he processes sound and tries to present the experience as a whole. Chandler also has plans to do more work with Budgie. They have some shows in Hong Kong including Talvin Singh and Damo Sazuki.

Chandler swears by the sound of his first TC Electronic product, the TC2290 Delay unit, which he has been using extensively for many years both in the studio for recording as well as on tour. Chandler agreed to create two TonePrints with us: one called the Toxic Verb Twister for the Hall of Fame Reverb and the other called Toxic Delays for the Flashback Delay, which reminds him of his trusty TC2290.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[La P&#233;dale is a retail shop located in the Parisian music hotspot of Pigalle. Though it does belong to a group owning several shops and developing online music retail as well, La P&#233;dale is pretty unique since it is specialized in effects only, mainly for guitar and bass players, but also for keyboards and vocalists. 

La P&#233;dale was founded back in 1986 and throughout the years it has become one of the go-to music shops when looking for specific effects and sensible, professional music advice. It is definitely a place where you&#39;d run into different kind of celebs looking for accessories to give their equipment that &#39;je ne sais quoi&#39;.

Today, Davy, Yannis and Fred are successfully running the place together, and have chosen to focus more on shop sales than online sales, simply because it is what they do best. Nonetheless, business is flourishing as they have sold more than 15,000 products last year alone. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Lee Ranaldo, born in 1956, is one of the original members of the American avant-garde band Sonic Youth.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Ranaldo started his career in New York where he collaborated with several artists, including Rhys Chatman. In the beginning of the 80&#39;s he co-founded the underground band Sonic Youth. They brought a new element to the 80&#39;s music scene as they explored unknown sonic territory with their dissonance, feedback and alternative tunings - effectively redefining the rock guitar sound. In addition to touring with Sonic Youth, Ranaldo has collaborated with and produced albums for artists like You Am I and Magik Markers. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Ranaldo the 33rd greatest guitarist of all time.
Although mostly recognized for his role in Sonic Youth, this string bending, hard working multi artist holds an awesome collection of solo albums ranging from &#39;From Here to Infinity&#39; released in 1987 to &#39;Between the Times and the Tides&#39; released in 2012.

Lee Ranaldo plays on a whole lot of different guitars. He usually favors a Fender Jazzmaster, a Telecaster Deluxe or even a Gibson Les Paul. He is very fond of modifying and alternating the tunings of his guitars. For instance, he plays a Jazzmaster with a single coil pickup installed between the bridge and the tailpiece, to exploit the resonation chiming sounds on that particular area of the string. Also, in 2007, Ranaldo had Yuri Landman build the Moonlander guitar - a guitar loaded with no less than 18 strings total; 6 normal strings and 12 sympathetic strings.

To name a few, the Flashback Delay, the Dark Matter Distortion and the MojoMojo Overdrive have all earned their rightful place on the stomp-box shelf of this dedicated musician. The sheer versatility of these TonePrint pedals is appealing to even the most dedicated of musicians, &#39;this pedal can do a lot of things […] I think one of the coolest things about it is the fact that it has this added aspect - that you can grab stuff off the net and download it right into the pedal and work with it&#39;.

Luckily, Ranaldo agreed to meet up with our technicians and help us create a bunch of awesome Lee Ranaldo-style TonePrints for both the Flashback Delay and the Hall of Fame Reverb pedals.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Growing up in L.A. in the 60′s, Grammy award winning guitarist Lee Ritenour received a rich cross section of exposure to jazz, rock and Brazilian music. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[From one of his first sessions at 16 with the Mamas and Papas to accompanying Lena Horne and Tony Bennett at 18, his forty year eclectic and storied career is highlighted by a Grammy Award win for his 1986 collaboration with Dave Grusin, Harlequin; 17 Grammy nominations; numerous #1 spots in guitar polls and the prestigious &#39;Alumnus of the Year&#39; award from USC. 

He has recorded over 40 albums, with 35 chart songs, notably the Top 15 hit &#39;Is It You,&#39; which has become a contemporary jazz radio classic. In the 90s, Ritenour was a founding member of Fourplay, the most successful band in contemporary jazz, with keyboardist Bob James, bassist Nathan East and drummer Harvey Mason. The first Fourplay album in 1991 spent an unprecedented 33 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard&#39;s contemporary jazz chart. Adding to this legacy is his latest CD Smoke &#39;n&#39; Mirrors; the recently completed Grammy nominated recording Amparo, (a follow-up with Dave Grusin to their highly-successful 2001 Grammy Award nominated contemporary classical crossover CD) and producer of Gordon Goodwin&#39;s Big Phat Band&#39;s latest CD Act Your Age (which is nominated for 3 Grammys.

It&#39;s been a long road since the seventies, when Ritenour&#39;s legendary Tuesday night appearances at the famed Baked Potato, with a band including Dave Grusin, Patrice Rushen, Harvey Mason and Ernie Watts became part of the musical landscape for five years. Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, George Benson, Al Jarreau, Joe Sample, and even Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell could be seen in the audiences that would pack the house till the wee hours of the morning. From rock to blues to jazz, his diverse music became the foundation of over 3,000 sessions as a young guitarist with a broad spectrum of artists such as Pink Floyd (The Wall), Steely Dan (Aja), Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, B.B. King, Frank Sinatra, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Ray Charles, Peggy Lee, Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand. Not to forget the dazzling array of talent appearing on his solo works and collaborations, notably- Phil Collins, Brazilian greats Ivan Lins, Caetano Veloso, Djavan and Jao Bosco, George Benson, Chaka Kahn, Herbie Hancock, Michael McDonald and opera great Renee Fleming.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Mark Christensen is the mastermind behind Engine Room Audio in New York, a place which has spawned hundreds of great sounding records with an impressive number of highly diverse artists, including 50 Cent, Depeche Mode, Toni Braxton and The Killers.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Mark started his musical career at the ripe old age of 16, when he started touring the Mid-west in a progressive modern-rock band. At age 19, Mark&#39;s production career took off, and he produced a number of independent records during a three-year stay in the UK, before returning to New York where he worked as a line producer at Soundtrack City.

&#39;I was in various bands in London in the early 1990&#39;s, and from 1995 I played with bands in New York&#39;, Mark explains. &#39;The best band I was involved with was signed, and we did a few tours opening for major acts such as Radiohead and Matchbox 20. At that time I had a really nice studio in my loft apartment in the East Village, where I started recording and mastering bands and The Engine Room basically grew out of that&#39;. The principle behind The Engine Room was to create a music business with freelance production, engineering and manufacturing, which would support Mark&#39;s career and that of others, and since then the founder himself has become a highly regarded Mastering Engineer in New York.

Mark&#39;s view on recording/mixing?
&#39;The main thing for me is always the purity of the sound, even if you are talking about the purity of distortion. I want to make sure I capture what the artist is trying to achieve sonically, and the less things that get in the way of that happening, the better&#39;.




With this in mind, we asked Mark to give his thoughts on System 6000 and how he uses it:

&#39;I&#39;m currently using TC Electronic&#39;s System 6000. We actually have two of them, one in the Mastering Lab here at Engine Room, and then we have one in our SSL-room upstairs.

Our two System 6000 units are used in a number of different ways. For the mastering environment there are a number of the algorithms like the Massenburg EQ that are just fantastic. I use System 6000 for my more &quot;surgical&quot; moves, both in an EQ context and in a compression and limiting context. System 6000 actually replaced a number of my other digital boxes as it just sounded better, and the flexibility of the converters is just amazing. Obviously, in the SSL room it&#39;s mostly reverbs. The imaging of the sound stage is the best I&#39;ve ever heard, and for me that&#39;s very important in a reverb unit&#39;.

Also, I&#39; like to mention the four separate stereo engines in just one system. This is great and allows for tons of routing options within just one unit&#39;.

Converter convert:
The thing that really gets Marks blood pumping is the converters in the System 6000:&#39;One thing I need to mention about System 6000 is the quality of the converters. It may be something that not too many people think about, but we&#39;ve got a lot of converters here in the Mastering room, all of the best from around the world, and I&#39;m always amazed at how the converters in System 6000 stand up against them. Conversion is essential in Mastering, and if you are working in the digital domain, you&#39;ve got to be able to get in and out of that domain the best way you can, and here System 6000 always comes through&#39;. 


What&#39;s up next?
&#39;We are getting ready to start Mastering the new Trey Songz record and I&#39;m looking forward to that. I master a lot of different styles of music, but his records are especially fun to work on because he can really sing, and the records are very well produced. We are also finishing mixes in the SSL room by a band I produced called Lowry. The record is being mixed by Drew Fisher (Dead Kennedy&#39;s, The Brian Jonestown Massacre), and it&#39;s coming together really, really well&#39;.

Apart from the mastering side of things, the future holds other projects for Mark Christensen, all of which require the same level of sound quality and reliability of the mastering equipment:

&#39;I recently starting producing again after a little hiatus, and I&#39;m playing guitar on those projects&#39;, he tells us. &#39;I&#39;ve got a few cool TC Electronic guitar pedals that I use and I&#39;m dying to get a G-System for my guitar rig. I&#39;m doing a project for Universal Australia where I&#39;m playing a lot. Gotta get my chops back!&#39;.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[There is no doubt that Mark King throughout his impressive career has been one of the most significant contributors in developing the voice of modern electric bass playing. He has always pursued a distinct sound as his characteristic and very percussive playing style demands clarity and a sound that cuts effectively through the mix. 

In short, Mark King took the slapping style that pioneers like Larry Graham, Bootsy Collins, Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller developed in the 70&#39;s in a whole new direction. Musically, he approached it differently, but most importantly, he brought the concept and sound of slap bass to the masses and provided tons of inspiration for the following generations of slap bass wizards. So it is safe to say that not only is Mark King an innovative musician in general - he is also a true slap bass extraordinaire.
Mark King kicked off his career with native British band Level 42, which he founded in 1979 together with his Mike Lindup and Phil and Rowland Charles. Initially King played the drums but soon moved to bass, where his natural rhythmic perception lead to his distinctive bass playing style. With time King achieved not only a rapid playing speed but introduced technical elements that allowed him to get incredible percussive effects while still playing bass.

Fame came quickly to Level 42 and the band played alongside artists like Madonna and Steve Winwood, while King and fellow band member Lindup also jammed with giants like Mark Knopfler, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and Elton John.
During the 80s, King started to focus on a solo career, personally issuing and selling his own CDs, home-made with the help of a computer, CD burner and inkjet printer. Fans responded positively and King soon toured world extensively. Lindup left Level 42 in 1994, but he and King reunited in 2004 under the Level 42 banner, mesmerizing fans with King&#39;s already famous talent for turning the bass into a drum. 

Such a passion for music requires using appropriate equipment - Mark King has opted for using TC Electronic&#39;s RS410 and RS450 bass amps to give his sound the raw power, flexibility and clean tone it needs. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Mark Sheehan (born Marc Anthony Sheehan, October 29th, 1981) is the guitarist and co-founder of the Irish indie-group &#39;The Script&#39;. His overdriven and highly reverberated guitar-sound is a key element in the group&#39;s musical expression.
]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[If ever there was a script for making it in the music industry, Mark Sheehan and his band colleagues Danny O&#39;Donoghue and Glen Power, seems to have stumbled upon it. Based on sheer speculation, that script would tell the story of two childhood friends growing up in Ireland dreaming of one day being discovered by a major music label, touring all over the world and opening shows for Paul McCartney or U2.

Of course all of this is speculation - We&#39;ll never know if such a script exists. We can only take notion of the fact that the two friends dream came true.

Sheehan and O&#39;Donoghue - who have been friends since the age of 12 - became a songwriting and production partnership in the mid-90s, and worked for a while in Los Angeles as songwriters and producers, but later moved back to Dublin, where they recruited Glen Power for their new band &#39;The Script&#39;.
The Script&#39;s eponymous debut album was released in 2008 where it went straight to the number one spot on the UK&#39;s album charts, mainly due to the success of the two singles &quot;We Cry&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Can&#39;t Be Moved&quot;, the latter reaching number 2 in Ireland, Denmark, and the UK. 2009 became a busy year for the band, touring all over the world and being the supporting act for Paul McCartney&#180;s three concerts at the New York Citi Field, before releasing their second album &#39;Science &amp; Faith&#39; in September 2010.

The Scripts&#180; latest album from 2012 simply bares the title &#39;#3&#39;, and contains their biggest single hit to date; &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; (here at TC that title really reverberates *wink, wink*). The single has been certified 5x Platinum in Australia, Platinum in Italy, 2x Platinum in New Zealand, 6x Platinum in Norway, 2x Platinum in Sweden and 2x Platinum in the US. The song also peaked at number 1 in the UK, Scotland, Ireland, Europe and Austria, and charted in over 30 countries.

The group is not intimidated by their own popularity though. They are still writing and recording everything themselves - as they always have.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Mark Tremonti is a guitar player who doesn&#39;t really need any introduction. As lead guitarist, founding member and a songwriter of his former bands Creed and Alter Bridge, Mark has received many awards, including the prestigious Grammy Award for Creed&#39;s single &#39;With Arms Wide Open&#39;.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Mark Tremonti&#39;s talent was acknowledged when he was named &#39;Guitarist of the Year&#39; by Guitar World 3 years in a row. In 2011 he was listed as a number four heavy metal guitarist of all time in Total Guitar Magazine. 

Mark has been interested in music since he at age 11 bought a cheap knockoff guitar. However, it was not before he graduated from college that he first assembled a band together with his buddy Scott Stapp. The band known under the name of Creed achieved international success and recognition.
 
About Creed:
 
Tremonti and Stapp are co-founding members of this American band, with the addition of a drummer Scott Phillips and bassist Brian Marshal. Creed managed to reach international success and became the first band that accomplished such a success with only a debut album. In 2004 Creed announced that the band was splitting up. Scott Stapp went on to pursue a solo career, while the rest of the band assembled a new group called Alter Bridge.
 
About Alter Bridge:
 
The new-formed band invited Myles Kennedy to be the lead singer. Alter Bridge embarked on a successful journey to success and released 3 critically acclaimed albums. The 4th album is to be released in 2013.
 
Tremonti always wanted to go a bit &#39;heavier&#39; with the guitar sounds, but he could never truly do it because it was not the sound of Creed or Alter Bridge. Hence Mark started developing the idea of solo album, where he could pursue his &#39;heavier-sounding thrash metal like&#39; sound. His debut solo album &#39;All I Was&#39; occupied the music stores in 2012 with Tremonti conducting the whole parade this time.
 
The album does not only reflect the different musical side of Mark, but also reveals him as a human being, where he sings about love, betrayal and isolation, more than ever before.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[If you play bass and you have an Internet connection, chances are you&#39;ve seen MarloweDK (Thomas Risell)&#39;s channel. This Copenhagen, Denmark native started his YouTube channel in 2006 and has been serving a wide variety of super useful bass lessons on his channel, which has had over 25 million views.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[MarloweDK is the star of the Playbassnow.com tutorial website for the bass community. He took up bass playing as a teenager having been brought up in a very musical family. Marlowe played in various Danish bands through the 80s and 90s including Buzstop, Paris Paris, M&#230;nd i Bl&#229;t, Back to back and Love Shop. He currently plays in Love Shop, Henrik Hall, and Al Campos &amp; SoulHarmonic and has appeared on many recordings, from Love Shop&#39;s Det L&#248;se Liv (1999, Polydor) to Al Campos&#39; Old School Lovin&#39; (2007). 

After pursuing a career in web design he noticed a gap in the market for on-line bass tuition. &#39;I got the idea to make tuition videos, teaching people the stuff I would have wanted someone to teach me,&#39; he says. The result is Playbassnow.com, a website full of great videos for the budding bass player. 

Marlowe is a fan of TC Electronic&#39;s RH450 and you can see him and it in operation in his latest video, Distortion Lick, in which the amp appears alongside the RS210 and RS212 cabs.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Martin Gore is guitarist and songwriter in hit electro band, Depeche Mode and his amazing career spans over three decades.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[He has numerous classics under his belt like &#39;Personal Jesus&#39;, &#39;Enjoy the Silence&#39; and &#39;I Feel You&#39; just to mention a few. In 1999, Gore received the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for &quot;International Achievement&quot;.

Gore started his career playing in a local band called &#39;Norman and the Worms&#39;, but that didn&#39;t pay the bills, so he also worked as a bank cashier. Nevertheless, in 1980 Depeche Mode was born and a new era for Gore was about to begin.

Depeche Mode was one of the first bands to establish their musical identity around the use of synthesizers and their dark and dramatic sound has made them stand out in the music industry. During the &#39;80s the band shaped electronic music, taking it from early New Romantic to a darker and more intense universe. With hits like &#39;Personal Jesus&#39;, &#39;It&#39;s No Good&#39;, and &#39;I Feel You&#39;, Depeche Mode took a confidant leap into the land of commercialism. They have sold over 100 million singles and albums worldwide making them the most successful electronic band in the world. 

Gore not only plays the guitar in the groundbreaking electro band, he is also the author of many of the band&#39;s hit songs. Furthermore, Gore has put out two solo records &#39;Counterfeit&#39; and &#39;Counterfeit2&#39;. Even though Gore is a talented songwriter, he has dedicated his two albums to other artists&#39; songs that he interprets into his own unique style. He has chosen songs - ranging from Iggy Pop to Kurt Weill - that have shaped his own sensibilities as a songwriter

In June 2011, Depeche Mode released a new album &#39;Remixes 2: 81-11&#39; which is a tribute to their long and succesful career. On the record, different artists present their take on classics like &#39;Wrong&#39; and &#39;Puppets&#39;.

We are very proud that TC Electronic is a part of Martin Gore&#39;s set up and we are looking forward to see Gore and Depeche Mode getting back on the road.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Matthew William Sorum is an American rock drummer and percussionist. Sorum is most famous for his 7-year stint in Guns N&#39; Roses (1990-1997) and supergroup Velvet Revolver (2002-present), which is comprised in part of former Guns N&#39; Roses members Duff McKagan (bass) and Slash (lead guitar).]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Officially moving on from GN&#39;R in 1997, Sorum brought his talents behind the board. He produced a Top 40 single for Poe entitled &#39;Angry Johnny&#39; as well as tracks &#39;Hello&#39; and &#39;A Rose is a Rose&#39; for Hollywood Records. Realizing he had a natural knack for bringing the best out of artists, he formed Orange Curtain productions with his partner Lanny Cordola. Together, they completed six film scores and produced platinum-selling artists including Candlebox, Sen Dog of Cypress Hill, Little Milton and Ronnie Spector.

However, drums always beckoned him back. Upon finishing a two-year stint rocking with The Cult, Sorum found himself in the studio with McKagan and Slash. The three shared a chemistry that could never be matched, and they founded Velvet Revolver. With Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots singing, Sorum released two explosive albums with Velvet Revolver—Contraband in 2004 and Libertad in 2007. World tours saw the band etch a legacy of their own buttressed by the hits &#39;Fall to Pieces&#39; as well as &#39;Set Me Free&#39;—propelled by a riff Matt wrote. 

In addition, &#39;Slither&#39; garnered the band a Grammy for a &#39;Best Hard Rock Performance&#39; and the band received another three Grammy nominations. Contraband also debuted at number one on the Billboard Top 200, selling three-million copies.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[While keeping it in the family, Tennessee-born brothers Caleb and Nathan Followill kidnapped their cousin Matthew Followill from his hometown in Mississippi in 2002 to play guitar in their band Kings of Leon, not allowing him to return home. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[He taught himself the ways of the six string and since then it has been a holy roller ride from humble beginnings to Grammy winning success for the now critical acclaimed guitarist, whose searing guitar work is at the core of the band&#39;s tender stadium rock sound.

The early noughties saw the return of guitar rock in fresh form with Kings of Leon being hailed as the retro-chic Southern rock equivalent of fashionable garage rockers The Strokes from New York. 

On their first release &#39;Youth and Young Manhood&#39; (2003) they delivered what the title so tellingly promised, dispensing their youthful energy in thrilling songs with firm roots in testimonial boogie rock, blues and country.  

Matthew Followill excelled in pumping up the songs with the kind of jagged guitar solos that inspired many a yearning bedroom guitarists. The album became a sensation in the UK and Ireland, where NME declared it &quot;one of the best debut albums of the last 10 years&quot;.

The band expanded on the gritty sound of their debut the following year with &#39;Aha Shake Heartbreak&#39; (2004), which solidified a steadily growing fan base abroad and gained even more domestic notice. 

After touring with the likes of U2, Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam during 2005 and 2006, a much matured Kings of Leon returned and showed new strengths in terms of song writing with &#39;Because of the Times&#39; in 2007. On this album the evocative guitar playing of Matthew Followill also ventured into new sonic territories. 

His new vocabulary of modern stadium rock sounds really emerged on the band&#39;s mainstream breakthrough two years later, their fourth album &#39;Only by the Night&#39; (2009). 

The album went to the top of the UK Albums Chart and reached number four on the US Billboard Charts. It was the UK&#39;s third-biggest-selling album of 2008 and the biggest-selling album of 2008 in Australia (being certified platinum nine times). Furthermore Kings of Leon won Best International Band and Best International Album at the Brit Awards in 2009

The album highlighted his characteristic use of reverb drenched harmonized stabs and beautifully sustained delay lines, while still being prone to the sudden flash of edgy lead playing. 

Just check out the beautiful album opener &#39;Closer&#39;, the octave pulsating &#39;Crawl&#39; or &#39;Revelry&#39;, where discrete slap back lines and pierced bends underline the pained lyric. You are of course already familiar with the great lighter anthems &#39;Sex on Fire&#39; and &#39;Use Somebody&#39;.

The next two follow up albums &#39;Coming Around Sundown&#39; (2010) and &#39;Mechanical Bull&#39; (2013) harvested on the fruitful foundation laid by the world dominating success of &#39;Only by the Night&#39;, the band kept busy playing more than 50 cities in North America and Europe during 2010, before a three-year hiatus followed in 2013, leaving fans restless to wonder. 

In the summer of 2016 a series of videos emerged from Kings of Leon on social media, building up anticipation to band&#39;s seventh album, this year&#39;s &#39;WALLS&#39;. The album was released in October and saw a triumphant return to form, earning rave reviews from both the music press and peers. NME remarked how the album felt fresh and applauded the band for staying true to their giant sing-along hook-selves. 

Of course the new album also features more of Matthew Followill&#39;s gifted playing and among the highlights are the solo of &#39;Muchacho&#39;, a personal favorite, he has stated in the press. The album stands as a testament to how a rocky foundation of guitar strings is still able to stand out with ear gripping intensity in the 21st century with a clearly defined identity that has mass appeal.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Max has toured and recorded with amazing recording artists Ella Fritzgerald, Peggy Lee, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin, just to name a few. It&#39;s no exaggeration to say: Max Bennett - a living bass legend.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Max is an internationally known bassist and composer and his experience spans from concert touring, recording and producing, to composing music for feature films and television. His many years of working in the studios has given him the opportunity to exercise his affinity for jazz, blues, rock and latin music, and to combine those elements into his music.

Max has truly had an outstanding career that many could only dream of and we got the opportunity to ask the legendary Max Bennett some questions about our gear and Max&#39;s fantastic career:

TC: How did you get into music and the music business?

Max: &#39;From my early childhood, I was obsessed with music and began playing guitar at very early age. I continued playing in the high school dance band albeit, not well, until I began playing string bass. From that moment on the bass was my sole instrument. I continued playing bass through high school and then through two years of college. At the end of my second year in college, I decided to pursue my career in music. I had always gravitated toward jazz and that is still my first love. I continued to play with various jazz groups in Chicago and New York and points west. Later, I worked and recorded with many well known vocal stars such as Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand and many more after moving to Los Angeles and eventually starting to work in the studios on movies, TV, commercials and record dates. In 1962, I bought my first Fender Precision E. bass and joined the ranks of those players who recorded for well-known artists in all styles of music. In 1972, I formed a group called L.A Express lead by Tom Scott, saxophonist. We recorded our own albums and eventually hooked up with Joni Mitchell for two great tours and four albums. I also recorded with a multitude of artists while still working as a &quot;studio musician&quot; including several Motown artists, Frank Zappa, Friends of Distinction and many others. Also during this period I became a writer of real contemporary jazz. This does NOT include so-called &quot;smooth jazz&quot; which I definitely do not subscribe to. I continue to work with my current group, Private Reserve&#39;.

TC: Which TC Electronic products are you currently using?

Max: &#39;I have played the TC Electronic RH450 until my recent acquisition of the TC RH750. Both amps are technically advanced in power, sound, ease of use, construction, weight, convenience and also damn good looking! Both are superb amps&#39;. 

TC: Where did you hear about TC Electronic gear, and what attracted you to it?

Max: &#39;I first heard about the TC Electronic RH450 on the internet. It sparked my interest immediately because of its power, light weight, great looks and the many features including the tuner in the amp and the RC4 foot pedal with three settings for individual sound&#39;.

He continues:
&#39;I use the gear both for live events and for all my recording. The electronics are very compatible with Pro Tools. What I notice most of all is how clean and flexible the sound is. Each venue you play at has its own situations and problems. The RH450 adjusts to all occasions easily! Also, having three separate settings in the RC4 remote serves me well in that I don&#39;t have to spend a great deal of time or effort to get the sound for each venue I want. Totally flexible.&#39; 

TC: What&#39;s your view or philosophy on recording and live playing?

Max: &#39;I compose all my songs at home. I notate everything including all the individual parts for each instrument. I use the amp with my bass to voice the chord changes and the bass lines. I do not record at home. For me, it isn&#39;t necessary. Everyone in my group is an excellent reader and we don&#39;t spend a great deal of time rehearsing. I take my charts to the gig and we run them through at the sound check. Then we are ready to play. I let the artist contribute what he wants and this makes it happen! By the time we have played a few venues the song is ready to record. We use a click track for all recording.&#39; ]]></artistBio2>

with the Pointer Sisters, Chaka Khan, David Benoit, Russ Freeman Project, Bryan Ferry, George Duke, and Lee 
Ritenour, just to name a few industry greats. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[In addition to his work with the above-mentioned artists, Melvin&#39;s

Melvin Lee Davis was discovered at the age of 16 by drummer Buddy Miles, when a horn player from Miles&#39; band heard Melvin playing in a local club. Miles flew Melvin to New York for an 
audition and immediately hired him for his touring band. After playing the New York club circuit, Melvin began 
writing and performing with R&amp;B singer, O&#39;Bryan from 1980 until 1987 through a record deal put in place by
Don Cornelius- even writing the 1983 theme song, &#39;Soul Train&#39;s A Coming&#39; for Cornelius&#39; weekly television 
show, &#39;Soul Train&#39;.

Melvin also has more than a dozen television performances including the Oprah Winfrey Show, The 
Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with David Letterman, HBO&#39;s &#39;The Chris Rock Show&#39;, and BET&#39;s 
&#39;Jazz Central&#39;. He has recorded tracks for the movies, &#39;Coming to America&#39; starring Eddie Murphy and 
Arsenio Hall; and &#39;Jump Shot&#39; starring Kim Basinger and Danny Devito.

Melvin clearly displays his skills as a master bassist, composer and producer on his first three
impressive solo albums, &#39;Variations in Time&#39; which was his first album that debuted in 1998; &#39;Tomorrow&#39;s 
Yesterdays&#39; which was released in the year 2000, and his third album that debuted three years later titled 
&#39;Nature&#39;s Serenade&#39;. Melvin and The Security Council released their 2006 album &#39;Homeland&#39; which featured 
contributions from Ron Bruner, Jr., Lee Ritenour, Mark Stephens, Eric Marienthal, Jeff Kashiwa and numerous
other notable artists. 

Melvin released his long-awaited and highly anticipated fifth album &#39;Genre: Music&#39; in May 2011. This 
album features: John Beasley, Gerald Albright, Lakin, Gene Moore Jr., Jeff Kashiwa, Ron Bruner Jr., Jesse 
Milliner, Allen Hinds, Rogerio Jardim, and Derrick James. &#39;Genre: Music&#39; clearly defines why Melvin is 
affectionately called and known as the &#39;Keeper of the Low Notes.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Michael Britt is probably best known as the twanging guitar player of the American country music group Lonestar.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Michael&#39;s interest in music, and the guitar in particular, began when he was in his early teens. As Kiss came out with the &#39;Destroyer&#39; album, the dream of every teenager - to take over the world as an axe-wielding musician - sparkled. When he finally discovered the awesome and legendary string-tapping equilibrist Eddie Van Halen, his mind was set.  Later on, he sought out inspiration through instrumental icons such as Mark Knopfler and Stevie Ray Vaughn.

Lonestar first charted in late 1995 with the single &#39;Tequila Talkin&#39;, the first of the band&#39;s twenty-seven singles on the country charts. Nine of the band&#39;s singles have reached number one on this chart. Their biggest hit was 1999&#39;s &#39;Amazed&#39;, a crossover hit that reached number one on both the country charts and the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first single to do so since Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton&#39;s &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; in 1983. The group has also recorded eight studio albums and a greatest hits compilation. Three of their albums have been certified gold, while three more have been certified platinum or higher.

When it comes to juicing up the sound of his guitar, Michael relies on a fair portion of sparkling stomp boxes from TC. The sheer versatility of the TonePrint pedals strikes Michael as the single coolest thing about them, &#39;The fact that we are able to taper the feedback differently than the depth. It makes almost like three different pedals in one box, and I don&#39;t think you can do that with any other pedal&#39;.
 
Michael is the type of musician who is always happy with his sound - a straight forward plug-and-play kinda guy rather than a ravenously knob-twisting sound tweaker. Thus, during a TonePrint session, we dialled in some of his favourite sound settings for the Corona Chorus, the Flashback Delay, the Shaker Vibrato and The Dreamscape and made them all available for some serious pedal-bank downloading.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Known equally for the intricate proficiency of his playing as for his unrivalled work ethic, Smoove currently serves as bass player for Jessie J alongside his musical directing for Tinie Tempah, Daley, Sasha Keable and emerging hip hop trio Hawk House.

Smoove grew up in a very musical family. His father is a singer-songwriter and guitarist and a young Smoove, keen to follow in his dad&#39;s footsteps and play the guitar, would always pick out bass lines as opposed to chord structures so it was quickly apparent that bass would be the natural path for him to follow.

At the tender age of 12, Smoove began to play bass at church, accompanying his father, and it was through church that he gained a lot of his experience and learned the art of playing by ear.
After leaving school, Smoove quickly became sure that music was his calling and set about tirelessly perfecting his craft and gaining as much experience as possible. Building on his experience of playing with artists such as All Saints, VV Brown, Pixie Lott, Blame Coco and Peter Andre, he branched out into the world of musical direction. In only a few years, his company, Major Tones Music, has become one of the most successful musical direction and musician staffing companies in Europe.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Said to be the new heroes of guitar bands, up there with Metallica and the like, Welsh metalheads Bullet For My Valentine is enjoying international success with sold-out headline tours in Europe, US, Australia and Japan. Simultaneous Top 5 chart entries for their latest album &quot;Scream Aim Fire&quot; are popping up across the globe. &quot;Scream Aim Fire&quot; sold 53,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart.

Combining a modern approach to metalcore and emo ballads with old-school 80s metal virtues, lead guitarist Michael &#39;Padge&#39; Paget lets his G-System handle the effects management while he&#39;s busy handling the uptempo riffing and harmonic shredding mayhem. Just home for a few days after an extensive Euro/US tour only to take off for Australia and Japan shortly after, the obvious focus of this interview is how his G-System performed on the recent tour. &#39;Well, nothing short of brilliantly&#39; is Michael&#39;s blunt reply to that question, followed up by &#39;no problems whatsoever.&#39; This comes from a guitarist that hadn&#39;t had his G-System more than a couple of weeks before taking off on tour.

Pedalboard trimmed down
Before turning to the G-System, Michael had a huge board packed with pedals, separate delay pedals for different delay types and decay times etc. And with two amps to select channels on and switch between for dirty and clean sounds generating the array of dynamics and intensity shifts that make up the signature of Bullet For My Valentine&#39;s hard-edged music, there&#39;s plenty of need for the control and effects management that G-System provides. &#39;I spent more time tap dancing than I did playing guitar,&#39; Michael recalls. &#39;G-System has really simplified things. It allows me focus my energy on playing rather than constantly being distracted by having to worry about which pedals to apply next - now one button gets the job done,&#39; he continues.

Once connected to the G-System relay connectors, switching channels on your amp is pedal simple: All you have to do is dial in the desired channel just like any other parameter setting you want to store in the preset bank that holds up to 200 user presets.
Less is more
Besides having G-System simplifying his setup, with the insane range of different stompboxes out of his signal chain, Michael has also experienced a remarkable sound improvement; &#39;It may appear to be a hackneyed phrase, but less pedals in your signal chain clearly equals less signal loss and less noise&#39; Michael declares with true conviction in his voice. 

However, noise elimination alone doesn&#39;t do the trick. What really makes G-System shine is its unsurpassed sound quality. Michael elaborates on his choice: &#39;There&#39;s just no getting around the fact that TC offers the ultimate delays and reverbs. Delay is my favorite G-System effect, but I also use its compressor to color my sound and add uniqueness&#39;.

Drag-and-drop easy preset sharing
Usually, guitar virtuosity goes hand in hand with gear nerdry. Not so with Michael. Being one helluva guitar player he is surprisingly indifferent to the technical side of things as long as he&#39;s got premium sound. 
&#39;I&#39;m really not much of a gear nerd,&#39; Michael says. &#39;I have Kevin, my guitar tech, set it all up, doing the programming and stuff. Cool thing; when we hit the US leg of our recent tour, I was really amazed with how easy it was to just copy the settings from my European G-System preset bank to the US board which the backline rental company had ready for us when we arrived.&#39; Thanks to the G-System Editor, aligning presets between two units has become drag-and-drop easy. This is not just convenient to meet increasing weight restrictions on most airlines, it is also pretty neat when you want to exchange great presets with your friends or when you want to get the tone of your favorite guitarist.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Michael Shuman, affectionately named &#39;Mikey Shoes&#39; by some, has come to be known for his stage antics and tremendous bass skills for the heavy rock outfit &#39;Queens of the Stone Age&#39;. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Having formed his first band at the ripe age of 14, Shuman is no stranger to the world of music and instruments. Although he is today known for his heavy bass lines for QOTSA, Shuman did in fact start off on the guitar. It was actually his longing for that &#39;perfect&#39; sound that turned him to play the bass since no one that he auditioned could capture the tone and style that he had imagined. 

Before he filled in the shoes for ex-QOTSA bassists, Alain Johannes, Shuman played bass and sang for the lesser known Wires on Fire, whom he had helped form. His entry into QOTSA came as a result of Wires on Fire having recorded an album with Alain Johannes and Natascha Shneider before. It also came just in time for him to play the tour for their fifth and latest album, Eva Vulgaris, released in 2007.

Josh Homme, founding member of QOTSA, is quoted as saying that he told Shuman &#39;playing in Queens is about &#39;performance&#39; and &#39;blood&#39;.&#39; When Shuman replied &#39;which do you want first?&#39;, Homme knew he was the man for the job. Shuman has followed up on Homme&#39;s expectations by adding his high energy and enthusiasm to the live shows. 

In 2009, Shuman decided to take a break after the Eva Vulgaris tour, which led to the formation of the new band, Mini Mansions, whose style has been described to be reminiscent of The Beatles. This could very well be Shuman&#39;s tribute to Paul McCartney who he references as his favorite bass player, although he has chosen to pick up drums for this particular project.
As far as equipment goes for QOTSA, Shuman says he uses &#39;an old SVT with an 8x10 and recently added an Acoustic 360.&#39; He runs them both simultaneously, as it isn&#39;t about loudness but rather about getting two separate tones and blending them into a new one.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Mick&#39;s been playing, touring and recording with Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo for nearly 20 years, but before playing bass for one of the world&#39;s most enduring Rock acts Mick had already built a solid reputation in the world of Jazz/Funk.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Mick&#39;s used a lot of amps over the years, but it didn&#39;t take long for him to become a convert of the RH750 sound: &quot;These amps are the bomb. On stage they just sound great - warm tone and I love the distortion capabilities. And I&#39;ve not had one complaint from monitor world or front of house.&quot;

Mick&#39;s credit list needs a page in its own right, but distilled highlights include Prince, Sheryl Crow, Alan Parsons, Keith Emerson, Steve Miller and Barry Manilow. To compile such a lengthy biography takes time, so it comes as no surprise to learn that Mick started playing guitar in his first band aged 11. After a few years the band needed a bassist, Mick volunteered and, as he says, &quot;immediately fell in love with the instrument&quot;.

He continued gigging after he moved to Los Angeles, where he promptly &quot;realized he needed a more formal music education&quot; to compete, so he set about furthering his studies in composition, arranging, reading and conducting at the Grove School of Music. He played in L.A. for 17 years, building up his reputation and business in session work and with many original bands.

When not on tour he writes extensively for television and environmental media, having turned in enough music to soundtrack a network for a week, including music for the likes of Michelob, Harley Davidson and MTV.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Mika Vandborg is known as one of the most talented and respected guitarists in Denmark. He has appeared on numerous recordings and has toured with some of the best musicians and artists such as Justin Hawkins, Love Shop, Gnags, Ida Corr, Mads Langer, Dicte and Claus Hempler to name a few.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Mika first picked up the instrument aged nine after hearing Jimi Hendrix on the radio. Technically he is now a virtuoso and has experience in many different musical styles and always shows his versatility as a musician and guitarist. When Mika&#39;s not playing with some of the most respected rock artists in Denmark, he&#39;s releasing his own material or writing music for TV.

Few guitarists can elicit the range of tones from their instrument as Mika Vandborg. It&#39;s easy to see why when you cast your eyes on the comprehensive pedalboard that gets barely a second&#39;s rest as Mika constantly drops effects in and out of the loop to add depth, power, grit and energy to his dynamic playing style.

Mika&#39;s attitude to playing is as uncompromising as his style of playing. &quot;Energy is my drive, that&#39;s what I&#39;m always aiming for. The music has to touch you... or it&#39;s a waste of time.&quot;

To beat the range of tone from his guitars, Mika uses plenty of gear, both new and vintage, but one name that pops up again and again is TC Electronic. Mika grew up close to the TC Electronic HQ and knew people who worked there, so he got to try out all the good stuff. Mika&#39;s first TC product has since become a sought-after classic. &quot;My first machine was the 2290 delay, but I  unfortunately sold it in a moment of confusion! I had all the first editions of the Phaser, chorus/flanger, booster and so forth….&quot;

Fast forward to today and TC is still Mika&#39;s go-to brand for post-overdrive effects. &quot;I&#39;ve got four or five set-ups and there is TC in all of them. I have an old G-Force in my rack set-up, it&#39;s been there for 12 years and is still going strong. I now use a lot of stomp boxes from TC, my favorites are the Phaser Xii, Hall Of Fame Reverb, Shaker Vibrato, the Flashback X4 and the original Flashback. I have tons of great old tape echoes and other good stuff in my collection, but it&#39;s hard to bring on the road, and to tell you the truth, &quot;I can&#39;t hear the difference when I play&quot;. The TonePrint series sound great and have made my life a lot easier. The tape echo in the Flashback is awesome!&quot;

&quot;TC gear is reliable, good sounding and I&#39;ve had lots of inspiring hours with the TonePrint feature.&quot;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Mike Mushok is the baritone-wielding lead guitarist for the American band Staind, one of the most successful rock acts of the new millennium.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Since the band&#39;s formation in 1995, Mike Mushok has been the lead guitarist, giving the band a unique, heavy sound by his use of baritone and 7-string baritone guitars.

The first two releases paved the way for the band by securing them opening spots for established bands such as Limp Bizkit and Sevendust. That was, of course, a huge break for them, but rarely has a band&#39;s career skyrocketed as it did following the 2001 release of their third album Break The Cycle. It was a huge international success for the band and it spent 3 weeks at number 1 position in the U.S. album charts and many weeks in the top 10 album charts of The Billboard 200 in the UK and New Zealand. It has since its release sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.

Staind has been successful ever since, having most of their albums reaching number 1 positions on the billboards. This does, however, not mean that Staind will rest on their laurels in the future. &#39;We&#39;ve seen too many bands come and go to ever feel like we have a sense of security,&#39; says guitarist Mike Mushok, reflecting back on his band&#39;s studio efforts. &#39;With each new album, we never want to rehash what we did before, but we also don&#39;t want the new music to be so different that it alienates our fans. We try to walk that line. As a band and musicians you want to grow and mature, not just put out another &#39;It&#39;s Been Awhile&#39; eight years later. You want something new that hopefully builds on that, and you want something that enables you to continue to grow as songwriters.&#39;

Mushok explains that Staind has been able to stand the test of time because they have focused their attention on music while too many of their peers were focusing on image, fashion and trends. &#39;You look at any band that&#39;s had any kind of longevity, and you have to have the music,&#39; says Mushok. &#39;Whether you&#39;re playing a heavy song or not, there has to be a catchy riff there.&#39;

In the past decade, Staind have sold more than 12 million records worldwide, had four No. 1 singles, six more singles in the Top 10 and their last three albums debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Album Chart. 

In march 2013, Mushok was announced as the second guitarist of the band NEWST3D, fronted by former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted.

To create his timeless catchy riffs, Mushok uses the G-Force rack in both his live rig and in the studio. Here&#39;s what he has to say about it…

I use the G-Force both live and in the studio - it&#39;s so versatile and really sounds amazing. The unit can do whatever I need it to. I first discovered it in the studio and came up with sounds I was unable to come up with elsewhere, which led me to incorporating the unit in my live rig. I couldn&#39;t be happier with it!

He also uses the SCF, the MojoMojo overdrive and the Flashback delay on his live pedalboard.

Through his career he has play with some of the worlds most prominent jazz musicians and released a dozen solo albums. At age 60 Stern doesn&#39;t seem to be slowing down.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[After ending his studies at Berklee College of Music, Stern landed a gig with Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears in 1976 and remained with the band for two years, appearing on the albums &#39;More Than Ever&#39; and &#39;Brand New Day&#39; before joining Billy Cobham&#39;s fusion band. Two years later he joined Miles Davis group, making his public debut on June 27, 1981, at the KIX nightclub in Boston, a performance documented on the CBS live album &#39;We Want Miles&#39;. He remained with Davis through 1983. From 1983 to 1984 he toured in Jaco Pastorius&#39; Word of Mouth band and in 1985 he returned to Davis for a second tour of duty that lasted close to a year.

His solo debut, Upside Downside, was released on Atlantic Records in 1986. It features performances by Pastorius, David Sanborn, and Bob Berg. From 1986 through 1988, he was a member of Michael Brecker&#39;s quintet, appearing on &#39;Don&#39;t Try This At Home&#39;. After releasing &#39;Time in Place&#39; (1988) and &#39;Odds or Evens&#39; (1991) Stern joined the Brecker Brothers Band in 1992, becoming a factor in the success of the popular group for the next two years.
Following this Stern went on to release two solo albums &#39;Is What It Is&#39; (1994) and &#39;Between The Lines&#39; (1996) - both of which received Grammy nominations. 
After 15 years with Atlantic, Stern shifted to ESC for the 2004 release of &#39;These Times&#39;, including guest appearances by bassist Richard Bona, saxophonist Kenny Garrett, and banjoist Bela Fleck. In August 2009, Stern released Big Neighborhood, which was nominated a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album.


Equipment:

The axe that got away for Stern, was a hybrid 1950s/1960s Fender Telecaster, which was stolen from him in an armed robbery in Boston. This guitar is the basis for Sterns custom guitar build by Michael Aronson - a Telecaster style body with an original 1950&#39;s Broadcaster neck - equipped with Seymour Duncan and Bill Lawrence pickups. Stern plays this through a pair of Fender &#39;65 Twin Reverb amps or the Yamaha G100-212 combo. Stern is a heavy user of chorus and delay effects that makes his sounds range from subtly swirling to positively psychedelic.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Nathan East is the Swiss Army knife of bassists. His extraordinary talent and versatility has led him to playing and recording across genres with the biggest talents in the music industry such as Michael Jackson, George Harrison, Barry White, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Phil Collins, and many more]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Nathan East is considered a true bass legend for more than one reason. First of all, there is no doubt that Nathan is a world-class musician, having laid down the bass lines on countless albums as well as on stage for many top artists. Second, Nathan is praised among producers and fellow bass players for always having an unparalleled bass sound. Simply put, Nathan not only plays with amazing feel, taste and musicality - he also sounds great while doing it!

To support the natural, great-sounding tone that begins at his fingertips, the last elements in Nathan&#39;s bass sound chain are a Blacksmith amp and two RS410 cabinets. Needless to say that it is a great honor for us that such a distinguished musician as Nathan - a player with a career simply beyond comparison - has chosen to let our Bass Amp 2.0 concept carry on the legacy of his fantastic bass sound! &#39;Rocking loads of power, outstanding tone and even a built-in tuner - TC Electronic has taken bass amps to the next level with the new Blacksmith,&#39; says Nathan East.
As a musician of integrity, musical diversity and longevity, Nathan East has recorded and performed with an extremely wide variety of mainstream pop/rock artists such as Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Eric Clapton, Babyface, Phil Collins, B.B. King, Elton John, Aretha Franklin, George Harrison, Joe Satriani, Anita Baker, Usher, Ray Charles, Toto and countless others. In fact, if you have listened to the radio, you have definitely heard Nathan&#39;s Grammy Award-winning steady groove, musicality and beautiful, warm sound. Further, Nathan also enjoys a reputation as one of the finest Contemporary Jazz bass players around, having played with artists like Herbie Hancock, Quincy Jones, Larry Carlton, Al Jarreau, Michael Bubl&#233;, George Benson, Sergio Mendes and &#39;Fourplay&#39;. In total, Nathan appears on more than a thousand recordings - a very impressive back catalogue and an undeniable proof of Nathan&#39;s massive bass authority, a testament to this player&#39;s love of his art.
Nathan&#39;s overall music philosophy is simple: &#39;I try to see the big picture and approach every song as a new work of art in constant search for the right colors, notes and personality. There&#39;s really no secret; exposure to as many different styles and genres help me navigate the playing field. I still feel like a student and continue to study all types of music.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Nick Beggs is currently the bass player for Steven Wilson and Kim Wilde. Over the years he has played with a huge number of artists including his own band Kajagoogoo,  Steve Hackett and John Paul Jones.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Nick Beggs hit the big time in 1983 notably as the bass player with Kajagoogoo. Their first single, Too Shy, reached number one in the UK and seven other European countries, as well as a number five in the USA selling a total of over four million copies. After the band split, Nick and two other founder members carried on under the name Kaja with some UK &amp; European chart success. Since then Nick has played with numerous artists including Belinda Carlisle, Alphaville and his own band: Ellis, Beggs &amp; Howard who enjoyed commercial success with the hit single Big Bubbles, No Troubles in 1988.

Nick is also known for his Chapman Stick playing which he describes as &quot;an instrument, which employs the technique of double-handed tapping. Both hands are free to tap directly onto the fret board enabling the player to cover bass and guitar parts simultaneously. With the added MIDI pickup you can also trigger as many synths as you wish. Put simply you can do the work of three players and hopefully get paid three times as much! But not always.&quot;
More recently Nick has been recording and touring with Steven Wilson, appearing on both hit albums &#39;Grace for drowning&#39; and &#39;The Raven that refused to sing.&#39; The TC RH450 &amp; RH750 have been an integral part of his stage set up for the past five years.]]></artistBio2>

Guitar					</artistSegment>
					<artistBio><![CDATA[Tsonev&#39;s guitar style is best described as a fusion of jazz, blues and rock covering a wide variety of playing techniques like the use of natural and artificial harmonics, wide interval arpeggios, whammy bar string bending, chordal two-hand tapping and creative use of effects.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Niko Tsonev is a Bulgarian-born virtuoso guitarist living in London, England. Starting music on the accordion at the age of four, Tsonev moved on to playing the guitar several years later. In his early teens, he started taking guitar and music theory lessons after becoming serious about making music. After relocating to London in 1996, Tsonev studied Music Production at Lewisham College and joined a musician session agency.

Tsonev has since continued to perform and record for artists and producers from very diverse stylistic backgrounds (Steven Wilson, JJ Grey, Youth, Digitonal, Aquilina and FabGrease Quentin), encompassing progressive rock, instrumental jazz fusion and blues through to urban and world music. His stylistic flexibility is showcased in his solo work and guitar playing style as well as his work as a film and TV composer.

The song Venetian Poison from Tsoney&#39;s solo album, Nix Hydra, was released as a video, which lead to Niko being recommended to Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree. In early 2012, this lead to Niko Tsonev being invited to join the Steven Wilson Band.

This is how Niko describes his long relationship with TC Electronic…
I&#39;m at the cross point of where my session work helps my solo career as a guitarist releasing music that pushes the palette of the guitar genre. And I strive to do so at a higher level, to grow artistically as well as musically, to do things with the guitar which haven&#39;t been done and focus on song writing depth and substance as much as on chops and technique, etc.

To be fair, my efforts as a solo guitar artist open more doors for great session gigs and I love doing it - keeps you on the edge - all these situations requiring musical stamina as well as great social skills. It&#39;s the best way to get better!

In terms of gear, I have used a lot of TC products over the years such as the M2000, M3000 and FireworX processors, but now I mainly use the G-System, both for effects, but also as an amp channel controller.

I still have to use different guitar rigs, though - they vary with the different gigs I do. Of course, everyone knows the G-System and the beauty there is in the consistency of the sounds. Your peripheral sounds-modulation/verbs/echos are there for you no matter what the amp is. And they are of top notch studio grade quality. So, in a scenario of having to deliver different type of overdriven sounds for different genres, I can easily patch in a different gain box to compliment a different amp or suit the gig better. It&#39;s just enormously versatile.

Other than that, I use several compact pedals such as the PolyTune, Dark Matter, Corona chorus, FlashBack delay, Hall Of Fame reverb and Shaker vibrato, all mixed and matched for different gigs… and I use the TonePrint App, of course.

I can&#39;t describe how impressed I am with the TC line of stomp boxes! This format seems to never die - on the contrary! So if you are doing a small jazz or blues gig, you can bring a couple of stomp boxes, beam the most suitable TonePrints for tonight&#39;s material from your phone... Future-proof!

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Omar Torrez plays &quot;narrative-driven&quot; music with invoking images of smoky bars, Mississippi Delta porch jams, Cuban rumbas, avant-funk and experimental sounds coloring his original, yet radio-friendly style.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Born and raised in Seattle (where the Omar Torrez Band was voted &#39;Best Band&#39; for three consecutive years by Seattle Weekly), the young artist received national attention when he won the National Jimi Hendrix Guitar Competition at the prestigious Bumbershoot Festival. After this victory, Omar embarked on a musical, spiritual and physical journey - traveling the world, studying Cuban and Andalusian gypsy music. Learning from the Cuban and Spanish musical masters such as Carlos del Puerto, Jr. and Juan Serrano, Omar immersed himself in classical and flamenco guitar. Living the life of a gypsy, he eventually found himself coming full circle back to his American music roots. Omar describes his music as equal parts rock, Latin, Delta blues, atonal classical and performance art. His heritage is as diverse as his music, ranging from Basque (via Mexico) to Norwegian, Native American and Russian roots.

This remarkable versatility caught the ears of Tom Waits who chose Omar to be his guitarist for the Glitter and Doom tour. His music now reflects these various experiences, revealing a multi-dimensional artist that is rare in today&#39;s music scene.

Besides Tom Waits, Torrez has shared the stage with musical giants such as Kinky, the Buena Vista Social Club, Jethro Tull, Pancho Sanchez, Susana Baca, Mumiy Troll, Francisco Aguabella and Viola Trigo, as well as underground favorites Indigenous, B-side Players and Sidestepper.

When asked about his TC gear, Omar said…

After schlepping around heavy pedal boards and suffering through broken pedal cables and malfunctions throughout my tours and gigs, I began to try out various multi-effect pedals and was not impressed. Then I heard the TC Electronic stuff at a friend&#39;s studio and was blown away. The NOVA System has analogue drive circuitry, warmth and versatility without sucking your tone away. PLUS, it can operate on European current as well. Now, no matter where I travel, whatever amp or PA system I endure, I always have my tones, without hassle, in a well-built box. That, together with the MojoMojo Overdrive and Polytune and I am set. Thank you TC!

Guitar					</artistSegment>
					<artistBio><![CDATA[Orianthi is an Australian guitarist, perhaps best known as the guitarist of the late Michael Jackson, but her solo career is taking off big time as well. She picked up the guitar when she was eleven and has played with the likes of Steve Vai and Carlos Santana.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Australian guitar wonder Orianthi Panagaris actually started out playing the piano at age 3, but she picked up an acoustic guitar at age 6. &#39;My father is a guitarist, so that&#39;s why I started playing,&#39; Orianthi says as she continues, &#39;I listened to a lot of Elvis, Roy Orbison and The Beatles when I was really young, and then I studied classical when I was 10. I moved on to electric when I was 11 after attending a Santana concert. I turned to my dad and begged him for an electric guitar, and when I got one, I never put it down. I have been playing guitar for 18 years, and I still have the same passion for it.&#39; 

In 2009, she released her debut album entitled &#39;Believe&#39;, and, over the years, she has been collaborating with legends such as Prince, Steve Vai, Carlos Santana - and of course &#39;The King of Pop&#39;, Michael Jackson.

This Is It
Orianthi became part of the &#39;This Is It&#39; band, but as we all know, MJ passed away before the shows even began, and it was as big a shock for her as it was to the rest of the world, and her spontaneous reaction was simply to start crying as it was for millions of fans everywhere. However, she is also extremely grateful to have been part of his band, and as she puts it: &#39;He made me believe in myself even more by making me part of the band - it was just a dream come true.&#39;

The Gear
Playing music at the highest level, Orianthi needs her gear to be at a similar level, which means that plenty of TC Electronic gear has found its way into her rig. &#39;Well, at this moment, I use G-Major 2 for some of my clean sounds such as combinations of Reverb and Delay. Also, the intro to my show is really dramatic, and it has a guitar part that needs a harmonizer effect. The effect from G-Major 2 sounds amazing and makes the part stand out more,&#39; Orianthi tells us. &#39;Further, my guitar tech, Danny &quot;Borga&quot; O&#39;Neil, has added a G-Force to my sound arsenal, and as we go along we keep discovering more and more stunning sounds, and finally, for my B-rig (fly rig), I use a Nova Delay as well as a G-System and a PolyTune.&#39;


&#39;The gear is incorporated into my rack, which is off stage, and my guitar tech runs everything, punching in my sounds when they are needed,&#39; Orianthi explains. &#39;The features and programmability of my TC Electronic gear are really amazing, and the cleanness really enhances my tone. My guitar tech listens to the sounds and simply programs what sounds right and it is off and running. The sounds are so clean and distinctive it just enhances my tone for certain parts.&#39;

Composing, recording and mixing
We also asked Orianthi about her approach to composing, recording and mixing. &#39;Well, my approach to songwriting is to just let the melodies and lyrics come to you and not to &#39;overthink&#39;. The best tunes have been the ones that didn&#39;t take too long to write,&#39; Orianthi elaborates. &#39;When it comes to recording, I really like to keep one of the first few takes as they tend to have the best vibe and energy. The best mixes to me are the ones that have a lot of clarity to them. Not a wall of sound, and all of the guitar parts are panned, so the vocals aren&#39;t buried in the mix.&#39;

What&#39;s next...?
Finally, we wanted to know what Orianthi has planned for the near future. &#39;Lots of touring,&#39; Orianthi replies, &#39;and my next album which I am already writing out here on the road.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Born in Israel, Oz started his professional career at the age of 13 playing jazz, blues, pop and rock music. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[By age 16, he was playing with top Israeli musicians and artists. By age 24, he was one of the most established studio guitar players in the country. Oz was also a member of the house band on Israel&#39;s top-rated television show for more than two years.

Since his 1996 arrival in New York, Oz has made a huge impact on the local and international music scene. His unique and intoxicating style has broken all the rules of instrumental guitar music by focusing on the groove. All stars such as Keith Carlock, Anton Fig, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Dave Weckl often contribute on drums, with bassists Will Lee, James Genus, and Reggie Washington.

In 2003, Oz released his debut record - &#39;Oz Live&#39; - recorded at NYC&#39;s legendary Bitter End.

In 2004, Oz signed with Magna Carta Records and in 2005, released his highly-acclaimed studio record &#39;HA!&#39; with his all-star band featuring Fig, Carlock, Lee and Genus plus special guests Mike Stern and George Whitty.

In April of 2007, a licensing deal with Magna Carta and Japanese label Videoarts opened the door for Oz&#39;s music in Japan. Later that year saw the release of &#39;Fuzzy Feat,&#39; Oz&#39;s third record under the Magna Carta label. For Fuzzy Feat, Oz&#39;s all-star band is joined by various special guests including Colaiuta, bassist Jimmy Johnson, and keyboardists Whitty and Jim Beard.

September 2009 saw the release of Oz&#39;s fourth album, &#39;Schizophrenic,&#39; featuring Lee, Fig, Carlock, Weckl, Ricky Peterson, Chris Palmero, and special guest Steve Lukather.

November 2011 Oz released his fifth studio album &#39;Twisted Blues&#39; Featuring Vinnie Coliauta, Anton Fig, Chris Layton, Will Lee, Roscoe Beck , John Medeski, Jerry Z, Reese Wynans, Ralph Macdonald and special guests Eric Johnson &amp; Allen Toussaint.

In late 2012 Oz released his two highly acclaimed instructional DVD&#39;s,&quot;Guitar Improvisational Workout&quot; and &quot;Play Along Workout&quot;, released by jazzheaven.com .

For his accomplishments as a trend-setting guitarist, Oz won the highly acclaimed Guitar Player magazine readers poll for &#39;Best guitar riff on a record&#39; in 2007, &#39;Best new talent&#39; in 2008, and &quot;Best out there guitar player&quot; in 2013.

Oz Noy has performed, toured and recorded with Richard Bona, Chris Botti, Gavin DeGraw, Harry Belafonte, Cyndi Lauper, Clay Aiken, Akiko Yano, Wonder Girls, Toni Braxton, Phoebe Snow, Nile Rogers, Mike Clark, Jeff &#39;Tain&#39; Watts, Dave Weckl, Mike Manieri, John Patitucci, The East Village Opera Company, Roger Glover, Bill Evans, The Gil Evan Orchestra,Warren Hayes, Gove&#39;t Mule, The Allman Brothers, Allen Toussaint, Eric Johnson, Mike Stern, John Abercrombie, Steve Lukather, John Medeski, Don Was, Nelly Furtado, Natasha Bedingfield, Phillip Phillips, Andy Grammer, Angelique Kidjo, Matisyahu, Jennifer Hudson, Henry Butler, Gart Hudson, Don Henley, Patti Austin, Take 6, Michael Buble, Josh Groban, Phil Ramone, Paul Shaffer, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Sting, Allison Krauss Foreigner, Patty Smyth, Wiz Khalifa, Shelea, Jordin Sparks, among others]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Pat Buchanan is one of Nashville&#39;s top session guitarists and has been so for many years now. Pat Buchanan has played the axe in many parts of the US and abroad all his life.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Pat was raised in Jacksonville, Lake City and Talahassee, Florida. His parents were jazz musicians and his brother his own personal Rock Guru. So, growing up in a family of musicians, for Pat Buchanan to become a musician was always encouraged. He picked up the interest in the six-stringed weaponry over night and determinately started playing and practising the guitar with his older brother. The determination of this young hard rockin&#39; musician resulted in his first ever gig, when attending only fourth grade.

During the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s, among others, Pat also recorded and toured with Cyndi Lauper. At the urging of producer Ed Seay, owing to the fact that Pat had many friends who worked all across the US, he decided to move to Nashville in 1993. He landed studio work quickly and has been successful as a first call session guitarist for many years. During this time, he played on many albums including hit records by Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney, Trace Atkins, Kim Richey, Rodney Crowell, Ray Davis of The Kinks and others too numerous to list here. Pat also won the 1996 ACM (Academy of Country Music) Guitarist of the Year award.

Besides this tremendous list of accomplishments and collaborations Pat Buchanan has also thrown himself into the world of solo careering. While staying in Nashville, he recorded a total of two records, &#39;Pat Buchanan&#39; released in 2002 and &#39;St. George&#39; released in 2005.

When he goes on stage, Buchanan is usually equipped with a certain set of sound effects - a very specific and dear armory to help ensure the crispy tone of his guitar. In this carefully selected palette of stomp-boxes we find the Corona Chorus, the Flashback Delay, the Vibrato Shaker and The Dreamscape - &#39;I&#39;m real excided about this vibrato pedal […] This Flashback delay is really impressive. It has the quarter notes, the dotted and the quarters and dotted right there on the preset. That&#39;s smart, that&#39;s super smart&#39;.

Quite naturally, we sat down with both Pat Buchanan and his trusted &#39;dog-in-arms&#39;, Ceasar the Tone Dog, and created an awesome package of TonePrints based on Pat&#39;s all time favorite sound effects.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Paul Geary is responsible for laying down the low frequencies of Nik Kershaw&#39;s band. In 1993, he was voted Best &#39;New Musician&#39; by the British Music Association and has since established himself as one of the UK&#39;s foremost studio bassists and active session musician.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Paul started his playing career comparatively late, having had no formal music training. He started playing bass in a gospel church at the age of 18 and shortly after this he went on to study music in the US and is now an Honors Graduate of Berklee College of Music in Boston USA, and B.I.T, Musicians Institute of Technology in Los Angeles, California.
He received his first break in 1991, working with soul diva Lisa Stansfield and Gabrielle. Shortly after this, he went on to work with Chris Rea and played alongside Jools Holland as part of the Princes Trust Rock School. Later in the autumn of 1993, he started playing bass for Chris Norman, the former lead singer of Smokie. 1994 brought relocation to London to head up to the Academy of Contemporary Music&#39;s bass school. Paul still found time in his busy schedule of full time courses at the Academy to lecture live performance workshops and he is also a contributor for Guitar Techniques &amp; Bass Guitar Magazine.
Three years later, in 1997, Paul recorded a new studio album and went on tour with Nik Kershaw. Two year later, a second album with Kershaw followed. Since then, the years have been busy touring and working as a music director and session musician with huge artists such as Lisa Stansfield, Gabrielle, George Michael, Simply Red, Chris Rea, A1, Nik Kershaw, Donny and Marie Osmond, The Lighthouse Family, Liberty X, Chris Norman, Geri Halliwell, Dane Bowers, Sophie Ellis Bexter, Clarksville, Enrique, Phix, Dside, Blazing Squad, Rachel Stevens, Mary J. Blige and Westlife.
When asked why he chose TC as his supplier of bass hardware for touring and recording, Paul replied…
TC Electronic gives me a true, clear, precise sound with loads of punch &amp; bottom end. It represents the sound of the bass perfectly. This, along with masses of power and the ability to easily store individual eq settings, makes it the best rig I&#39;ve ever used.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Paul Brandon Gilbert is known for his technical guitar work with Racer X and Mr. Big. He has been voted number 4 on a list in GuitarOne magazine of the &quot;Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time&quot;, and holds a spot in Guitar Worlds 50 Fastest Guitarists of All Time list.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Ambitious at an early age, around 1981-82 Paul contacted Mike Varney, founder of Shrapnel Records, asking for a gig with Ozzy Osbourne. At that time, Varney couldn&#39;t think why Osbourne would want a 15 year old guitarist, but after listening to Paul demo he changed his mind. In 1982, fifteen year-old Paul Gilbert appeared in Guitar Player magazine for the first time, holding a homemade Flying V in his hands, and proclaiming his style to be &quot;Heavy Metal.&quot;

By the age of 18 he had moved to Hollywood, California, won the Los Angeles &#39;Guitar Wars&#39; contest, graduated from G.I.T. (The Guitar Institute of Technology), and started teaching there as G.I.T.s youngest instructor. At 19, Paul formed the now-legendary shred-metal band RACER X, and recorded his first album with the group. 

RACER X soon became kings of the Los Angeles club scene, and continued to record melodic, yet intimidating metal music, including the instrumental classic, &#39;Scarified&#39;. Gilbert left Racer X in 1988, but ten years later he contacted the members of Racer X for a reunion. In 1999, the band recorded the album, Technical Difficulties, which went gold in Japan.
 
At 21, one of Paul&#39;s musical heroes, bassist Billy Sheehan (Talas, David Lee Roth) asked him to join him to form a new band. This band became MR. BIG. Together with vocalist Eric Martin and drummer Pat Torpey, MR. BIG went on to make many classic albums, combining elements of rock, metal, pop, soul, and shred. While in MR. BIG, Paul enjoyed the success of the number 1 hit single &#39;To Be With You&#39;, and the opportunity to perform in sold-out arenas all over the world. Gilbert continued playing in Mr. Big in the 1990s. During that time he became famous for using a Makita cordless drill with three picks mounted on the end of it, which he used most famously on the Mr. Big track &#39;Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little boy&#39;. 

At 30, Paul felt the urge to take complete control over his musical direction, and left MR. BIG to pursue a solo career. Since then, he has recorded over 20 albums of high-energy guitar rock. Sometimes with vocals, sometimes instrumental, sometimes with his mates from RACER X, and sometimes in collaboration with his uncle, Jimi Kidd, singer/guitarist Freddie Nelson, or with drummer Mike Portnoy.

Apart from being a touring and recording musician Paul is also the most sought-after and YouTube&#39;d guitar instructor of his time. Paul&#39;s instructional DVDs and magazine columns have become Shred Encyclopedias for a new generation of guitarists. Listen to any fast metal guitar player today, and you&#39;re sure to hear some phrases borrowed from Paul&#39;s &#39;Intense Rock&#39; DVD.

In 2007, Paul joined guitar legends Joe Satriani and John Petrucci for the &#39;G3&#39; tour of North America. In the years since, Paul has performed over 250 shows with his band in Europe, Japan, and America.

Paul&#39;s recent touring and recording with MR. BIG has put him once again at the forefront of today&#39;s guitar scene. Paul now enjoys playing shows at the sold-out Budokan arena in Japan, rocking out for massive audiences at European rock festivals like Download, Gods of Metal, and Sweden Rock, or headlining for thousands of fans in South America, the USA, Indonesia, and Russia.]]></artistBio2>

											<youtubeDescription><![CDATA[Check out Paul Gilbert showing off his personal TonePrint for TC Electronic&#39;s Corona Chorus guitar pedal. Paul wanted to create a sweet, shimmering chorus sound that would be equally suited for clean and dirty sounds. He chose to go with the &#39;tri-chorus&#39; mode of the Corona Chorus pedal, and he came up with the name for this TonePrint as the warbly and gooey feel of the sweet chorus reminded him of one of his favorite desserts: caramel. The &#39;triple&#39; refers to the &#39;tri-chorus&#39;, of course, and the he felt that the clean sound would represent the &#39;apple&#39;. The result? Delicious!]]></youtubeDescription>

											<youtubeDescription><![CDATA[In this video, guitar legend, Paul Gilbert, demos his personal TonePrint for TC Electronic&#39;s Hall of Fame Reverb guitar pedal. Paul wanted to get a nice tail of space. A reverb tail of comfort that adds that certain something to any guitar tone - even when sustaining the notes. As for the naming of this particular TonePrint, Paul refers to the alias that he was actually planning to use for his next tour. In order to prevent fans from calling up his hotel room in the middle of the night, he always uses a fake name when checking in to hotels - and for the upcoming tour, he had planned to use this name: Otis Fieldsgood! Now, he decided to use it for naming this TonePrint instead!]]></youtubeDescription>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Paul Riario rocketed to fame as the tech editor of Guitar World. The classic &#39;hey this is Paul from Guitar World and today we&#39;ll be looking at ...&quot; has a guaranteed place in the brain of every guitarist under 40.

]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[But there&#39;s more to Paul than meets the YouTube eye. Much more. Naturally cool, Paul is genuinely passionate about music. He plays in several bands, has covered every genre from rock to country and back and is often happiest at home, spending time with his wife, new born daughter and his three dogs. Who show surprisingly little interest in gear.

Paul&#39;s been with Guitar World for 15 years and he started out as a production coordinator. The gods of rock took a liking to him and next thing he knows, he&#39;s out doing videos. Paul is one of those guitarists that loves playing. While gear means a lot to him and he considers himself a gear head - he&#39;s more into playing and pure, undiluted tone. 

One of the coolest things Paul said was that over the years, he went from owning just about all the gear on the planet, to actually scaling down to what sounds the best, and the essential tools he need to get a certain job done. This has helped him keep a really open mind as a tech editor and allowed him to understand that while some gear may not be right for his style of playing, it might work great
for players in a particular genre.

Paul&#39;s however avoided the trap most people fall into when working in the music business: they get cynical about gear. This is not what Paul&#39;s about at all, he still gets genuinely excited about new gear and guitars - and we still love his vids!

When Paul visited TC, his immense knowledge of gear, passion for tone and music and genuine &#39;coolness&#39; were immediately appearant, and his TonePrints represent all these elements perfectly.

Currently, Paul plays in a country band called Radio Nashville, and uses the following TC products for his rig: Flashback X4, Flashback, Spark
Boost and PolyTune Mini.]]></artistBio2>

Paul has always been a big fan of the original 2290 and loved the fact that he can now get that sound in the Flashback X4. A delay that works with your playing, the delayed tones will be &#39;chasing&#39; what you play in a very rhythmic fashion.]]></youtubeDescription>

											<youtubeDescription><![CDATA[Paul does not use reverbs frequently, but genuinly loves how a reverb can help you get &#39;lost&#39; in sounds - he went for a very deep reverb with a dark edge, which caters really nice to single coil pickups, but works wonders for humbuckers as well, with its pronounced, deep and church-like ring. This TonePrint will really help your playing become more &#39;reflective&#39;, as if you are actually in a cathedral.]]></youtubeDescription>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Paulo Jr. is born and raised in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. He is the bassist in the Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura where he is the longest remaining member with presence since &#39;85. When he is not smashing away on his bass he enjoys Jiu Jitsu and soccer. 

Paulo Jr. first met the brothers Max and Igor Cavalera in &#39;84 at a local hippe square where people met and hung out. Through a mutual friend he was introduced to Max and Igor and they all begun hanging out. Around a year later he became a member of the band Sepultura. Today the band consists of Andreas Kisser and Paulo Jr. In total Paulo has released 15 albums with Sepultura and toured the world.  

In 2009 a Brazillian extreme metal project &#39;The Unabomber Files&#39; emerged with Paulo Jr. on bass alongside Allan Wallace and Andr&#233; M&#225;rcio from Eminence and Vladimir Korg from The Mist/Chakal on vocals. The purpose of the band is to play simple and heavy raw music with sarcastic lyrics. 

Besides being a bad ass Paulo has a soft side. Since 1999 he has organized a series of annual football charity games between former Brazilian players, TV artists, musicians and the band members. Attendances were asked to bring one pound of food, which was given to local charities. 

Through his career he has worked with Scott Burns, Jairo T, Edguard Santos and of course Sepultura. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Peredur ap Gwynedd is a Welsh guitarist, born and raised in South Wales. Ap Gwynedd is mostly known as a member of the Australian rock/electronica band, Pendullum, but he has also performed with acts such as Natalie Imbruglia, Norman Cook, Sophie Ellis Bextor and Mylene Farmer.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Pendulum&#39;s guitarist, Peredur ap Gwynedd, explains why TC Electronic&#39;s G-System never leaves his side. &quot;It is quite simply the best effects unit!&quot;

Take one look at the high-octane Drum &#39;n&#39; Bass phenomenon that is Pendulum and you soon realize that this band challenges every rule in the music production handbook.
The music that they make defies categorisation, veering as it does from dark Drum &#39;n&#39; Bass to catchy &#39;Rock-out&#39; Pop but it is certainly a successful mix. When they played in front of tens of thousands at BBC Radio 1&#39;s &#39;One Big Weekend&#39;, headlining with Madonna, surely even they must have pinched themselves and wondered quite how they&#39;d done it. Some of this success can undoubtedly be attributed to the fact they present their Dance sound with heaps of Rock attitude, so a Pendulum gig mixes conventional guitars with DJs, MCs with synths and mighty drums with samples for an unbelievable and unforgettable live experience.

Peredur ap Gwynedd joined Pendulum as guitarist, having previously played for some very high profile acts - including a nine-year stint with Aussie songstress Natalie Imbruglia. 

&quot;I&#39;ve played with all sorts,&quot; he says. &quot;I started working with Pendulum in 2004 and played on the first album. And then a couple of years ago they asked me to join full time. Then we got signed to Warners… and the rest is history!&quot;

While the band avoid the traditional software-only route to dance music, they are not afraid to embrace the best of other technology and Peredur has just that with his G-System, TC Electronic&#39;s unique and powerful floor-standing effects package that also offers integration and control over your existing guitar effects.

&quot;I&#39;ve used all sorts of effects in the past,&quot; says Peredur, &quot;but a couple of my friends had G-Systems and said that it was the dog&#39;s bollocks. I saw the specs and thought, &#39;yeah that&#39;s exactly what I need&#39;. It seemed to do everything and was very sturdy.&quot;

His initial conclusions have been proven correct, as the G-System has been at his feet for the band&#39;s recent major world tours, proving to be an indispensable addition to Peredur&#39;s sound. 

&quot;It sounds great and is quite simply the best effects unit,&quot; he says. &quot;The versatility is another boon - the fact that you can put your favorite effects and amp sounds into G-System&#39;s effects loops and let G-System change the parameters on them is quite an amazing thing.&quot;

Peredur then goes on to detail how easily he blends his older pedals and effects into the world of G-System…

&quot;It&#39;s fantastic,&quot; he begins. &quot;I use it with a Hughes &amp; Kettner TriAmp Mark II. The TriAmp has six different preamp channels and I utilize all six of these with the G-System&#39;s effects loops. I also use a Mesa Boogie V-Twin in one of the loops, a Hughes &amp; Kettner Rotosphere - the Leslie Simulator - and a Keeley Modded Tube Screamer.&quot;

Peredur clearly knows a good sound, but G-System not only allows him to integrate and control his favorite effects, it also allows him to quickly and easily switch the order of them in the effects chain - something that would previously have taken an age to do.

&quot;It&#39;s very straightforward to edit G-System and use the software that comes with it as an effects management system,&quot; explains Peredur. &quot;With most effects units it takes a long time and some patience to change the effects order, but with the software that comes bundled with G-System it&#39;s made my life so much easier.&quot;

&quot;I can chop and change effects within the system at the drop of a hat. Recently we had a massive overhaul in the set list, brought in new songs, changed the order quite dramatically… and it took less than three minutes to change the order of the songs in the G-System.&quot;

But Peredur is not only using G-System as a controller - he&#39;s also impressed with the unit&#39;s onboard effects. &quot;It&#39;s an amazing sounding piece of equipment,&quot; he says. &quot;The delays are fantastic and the modulation is top notch. I use a smattering of delays to beef up the sound whenever I&#39;m doing a solo or playing a lead line. And at the end of our set I use a patch with infinite repeats, so I&#39;m using it as a sample/hold. It repeats the last phrase I play as we walk off.&quot;

Overall, though, it&#39;s the fact that G-System has survived life on the road that impresses Peredur the most as he concludes: &quot;One of its best features is how it&#39;s built. I&#39;ve done over 170 gigs with it and it&#39;s had its fair share of knocks, drinks have been spilled on it, and a flight case even fell on it, but it still works perfectly!&quot;

Pendulum&#39;s third album, Immersion, is due for release in May and the band will be touring around the UK and Ireland to support it.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[As a studio guitarist for producer Linda Perry, Peter Thorn has played on albums by Courtney Love, Alicia Keys, Daniel Powter, Ben Jelen, and others.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[And with G-System as an integral part of Peter&#39;s touring setup - it has delivered rock solid performance at 150+ worldwide live concerts with Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Audioslave) - chances are that you&#39;ve already heard Peter&#39;s
G-System live in action or on your favorite album.

Between this impressive number of concerts and extensive sessions in Linda Perry&#39;s incredible Toluca Lake studio, Kung Fu Gardens, Peter has really gotten into the ins and outs of his G-System. He fell so hopelessly in love with the integrated effects management system that one unit just wasn&#39;t enough; he&#39;s granted himself the luxury of one for his touring setup, one for studio work and a back-up unit just in case. 

It&#39;s not a feature - it&#39;s the future
Today&#39;s DSP technology allows us to pack the renowned TC processing power and sound quality into just one convenient floor-based unit - a performance level that previously took a whole bunch of dedicated rack units to achieve. An increasing number of touring musicians have turned their backs on traditional rack setups and gone for the portable convenience of G-System - artists you&#39;d expect to have enough road crew, stage hands, guitar techs etc. to handle whatever heavy equipment they may carry along on tour. So there&#39;s more to it than portability.
Peter Thorn nails it: &#39;I am not a &quot;dance on pedals&quot; kind of guy. Since the mid-1990s I&#39;ve been using loop switchers to control my pedals, while incorporating rack effects units for their MIDI- switching abilities and quality of reverb, delay, and modulation sounds. I want, and have grown accustomed to, the ability to hit one button on the floor and have EVERYTHING change, my amps, effects, everything. My G-System rigs give me that kind of programmability, great sound and versatility in a pedalboard format- it&#39;s a one of a kind product!&#39; Commenting on the easy setup he continues, &#39;I feel really confident that I can do any gig and session now with just my G-System, whereas before I needed at least my 6-space rack and former pedalboard to make things happen. The
G-System has worked flawlessly for over 150 Chris Cornell shows, so I have no worries about reliability. I know it&#39;s dependable night after night in front of thousands of people. The sounds are going to be there, it&#39;s going to translate to the crowd, and it&#39;s built like a tank so I don&#39;t need to worry about it breaking down on me!&#39;
There are probably quite a few stage hands out there welcoming this trend.
In the studio, time is money
G-System has also proven really effective for Peter&#39;s studio work. Besides having great ears for spotting the right sound, the perfect take, creative rearrangements etc. every studio owner&#39;s concern is something as pragmatic as time. When you hire in session musicians for a project the last thing you want is to waste everybody&#39;s time. The faster/easier studio musicians achieve the sounds the recording artist and executive producer are after, the better. Also in this respect, Peter has experienced just how easy G-System gets the job done. &#39;I often need to get great sounds quickly. I once A/B&#39;ed running through the G-System rig and just running straight into the amp in the live room through 40 feet of cable. The difference was spelled out and everybody got it right away - it sounded absolutely natural and there was no loss of signal when I used my
G-System rig on a totally dry preset, because it&#39;s all buffered, and I could of course then add effects to taste (I love the Vintage Phaser which I&#39;ve been able to closely simulate the sound of my vintage mxr phase 90 with) and switch between different amps on the fly, etc. It allows us to track so much faster and with great sounds, all presetable and instantly recallable of course! &#39;
Environmental bonus
And hey, it&#39;s a good feeling to play overseas shows like Earth Day knowing that I no longer bring a huge rack of effects on the plane - sort of my humble contribution to lowering co₂ emissions&quot; Peter Thorn adds. Of course all of G-System&#39;s manufacturing procedures are RoHS compliant, meaning that not only has TC implemented lead-free soldering, but components provided by suppliers also meet the requirements specified in the RoHS Directive on restriction of hazardous substances. So rest assured that on top of taking your talent to a level you never thought possible, G-System will up your environmental-friendliness.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Phil Campbell is the guitarist of rock behemoths Mot&#246;rhead, and responsible for delivering some of the dirtiest, sexiest  most fist-pumping riffs and licks in the history of rock.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[All time legends and hall of famers such as Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Tony Lommi and Michael Schenker have served as an inspiration for many a great musician of our time - and Phil Campbell is no exception. This rockin&#39; guitarist began his musical journey at age 10, when he picked up a guitar for the very first time. By the time he turned 13 he semi-professionally partook in a cabaret band called &#39;Contrast&#39;. Later on he was playing all across South Wales in a band called Rocktopus and in the year of 1979 he formed the heavy metal band, Persian Risk.
 
During a Hawkwind gig, at only 12 of age, Phil was lucky enough to get hold of Mot&#246;rhead frontman Lemmy&#39;s autograph. So, when Lemmy was holding auditions for a new Mot&#246;rhead guitarist, due to the departure of Brian Robertson in 1983, Phil was destined to try-out. Although seeking out only one guitarist, upon discovering the roaring synergy between Phil and guitarist Michael &#39;W&#252;rzel&#39; Burston, Lemmy decided to keep them both - a Mot&#246;rhead gang had yet again risen. To this day, Phil Campbell remains a member of Mot&#246;rhead, in spite of a wide range of line up changes throughout the years.

Phil&#39;s choice of guitars, when either playing live on stage or recording in the studio, often falls upon his LAG Explorer Signature model armed with two Seymour Duncan humbuckers or his Minarik Inferno Guitar. But his personal weaponry of thundering axes also features guitars such as a Parker Nitefly, a Claymore custom, guitars built by Luthier TC Ellis, guitars from Framus, DBZ, Caparison, Jackson, Kramer, ESP, PRS, DBZ and Charvel.

Phil is running his guitars through a range of effect pedals from TC as well, and we sat down with this legendary rock star to create a couple of TonePrints for some of his favourite sounds. Among others he created a thick psychedelic vibrato Hendrix-ish sound to jinx up the soul of his sound and a short delay kinda sound for those ravenously roaring guitar solos.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Three-time Grammy nominee and Emmy Award-winning bassist Philip Bynoe is a prolific recording and touring musician. Though best known for his work with virtuoso guitarist Steve Vai, Philip has played everything from heavy metal to R&amp;B to classical.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[He has worked with the likes of Kevin Eubanks and &#39;The Tonight Show Band,&#39; Dorian Holley, Slash, Charlie Farren, and &#39;Ring of Fire&#39; with Tony MacAlpine. 

Music has been the focus of Philip&#39;s life since early childhood. His father played string bass in an orchestra and his mother played cello. They wanted all of their five children to learn a musical instrument. So, at age six, Philip began to study cello. Later, he studied guitar. But it wasn&#39;t until he picked up his father&#39;s electric bass in sixth grade that he found his &#39;voice.&#39; Soon after, he joined a band called &#39;The Soul Explosions.&#39; All throughout middle and high school, he played in every band he could. 

After high school, Philip attended The Berklee College of Music in Boston. He studied with Wit Brown and practiced for hours every night. Then he joined a cover band called &#39;Flash&#39; and began playing six nights a week in a local night club. 

He changed bands several times in the ensuing years. Eventually, Nuno Bettencourt of &#39;Extreme&#39; introduced Philip to Mike Mangini. Soon, he and Mangini were playing together in the &quot;Rick Berlin Band.&quot; They entered and won a rhythm section competition in Massachusetts. And it was Mangini who later got Philip an audition with Steve Vai. All the years of discipline and steady playing paid off. Philip landed the gig. He recorded and did many world tours with Vai. He has received three Grammy Award nominations for his work. In 2005, he furthermore received an Emmy Award for his work on the soundtrack for a remake of Reefer Madness. 

Philip continues recording, touring and playing out. As a labor of love, he is currently recording and releasing children&#39;s albums with two groups, &#39;PB &amp; Deb&#39; and &#39;Jambo&#39;. And his versatility keeps him in high demand with an eclectic range of artists. He also teaches bass and ensemble work at the L.A. Music Academy in Pasadena.

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Not unlike countless rock bands, ProGuitarShop&#39;s humble beginning started from a garage in Portland Oregon. Emerging in 2004 as an eBay store selling used amps and guitars, as well as parts and accessories, ProGuitarShop.com formally was born in 2007 launching their website dedicated to boutique guitar effects.

Toward the end of 2007 PGS pioneered a new video marketing platform that is widely used today. One at a time, a library of product demonstration videos commenced and has since grown into the world&#39;s largest video demo library. These videos also introduced the viral, cult-like following of Andy, PGS&#39;s primary video personality and effects aficionado. His demonstrations have shown people around the world what these boutique items can do, while simultaneously putting a new spin on Internet marketing.

Not only has their video marketing taken PGS to new heights as a global retailer of boutique instruments and effects, but the viral nature of their social media marketing has opened an entirely new demographic of players around the world and brought the once small boutique market to the forefront of today&#39;s electric guitar retail industry. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Riginald &#39;Fieldy&#39; Arvizu plays a mean bass in KoRn. His percussive style on the bass inspired by hiphop music fronts the metal phenomenon with one-of-a-kind bass lines. In total a crazy dude that rocks hard. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Reginald Arvizu better known as &#39;Fieldy Snuts&#39; (feel these nuts) was born on November 2nd, 1969. His father played in a band so Fieldy was born into music. He got his first bass guitar from his father at the age of 5 beginning his life as a rock star. 

Before skyrocketing to the top of the charts with KoRn, Fieldy played in many bands with high-school friend and KoRn-member Brian Welch. Then Fieldy co-founded the band L.A.P.D (Love and Peace, Dude, later Laughing at People Dying) with KoRn-member James Shaffer and Richard Morill. David Silveria (former KoRn-member) was added on drums. The band released one studio album, but did not reach the success they all craved. And so KoRn was created. The band swooped to the top of the charts and fronted the nu metal phenomenon.  

Fieldy became a rock star and acted likewise. In 2009 he changed his ways and revealed his story in his memoir &#39;Got the life: My journey of addiction, faith, recovery and KoRn. A tale of how he became religious, quit drugs and found the better part of himself.

Besides kicking ass in KoRn, Fieldy has a side project he calls &#39;Fieldy&#39;s dreams&#39;. It is a rap/hiphop project where he has released the album &#39;Rock&#39;n Roll Gangster&#39;. When he takes a break from music he manages KoRn&#39;s merchandise by designing t-shirts, hats and stickers. The remaining KoRn members make the decision on whether or not Fieldy&#39;s designs are going to the stores. Fieldy shows his work and they either approve or disapprove the designs.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[The Danish country lover Rene Shades is the badass bassist in heavy rock/metal band Pretty Maids and co-founder of Shades &amp; Peters. Shades keeps a busy schedule as a bass player, producer and songwriter.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Ren&#233; Shades enjoys simplicity and great sound when creating music and that is what he gets with his TC board. He plays with different basses during shows and enjoys easy control over the amps which he gets with his TC multiple amp setup and LEDs on the knobs.

&#39;It has just made the creativity much easier with less hassle and it sounds exactly the way I like it&#39;

Shades began his career by founding the band Sateria with childhood friend Martie Peters. At first it was a sleaze/glam rock band but soon passed to biker rock. Unaware at the time that he would become the bass player in Pretty Maids, Sateria held their first concert at a friend&#39;s parent&#39;s house playing two Pretty Maids songs. With only one album out (Crash Bang Boom) and not reaching the success they desired the band dissolved around mid 90s. 

In 2010 Shades got together again with childhood friend Martie Peters and founded &#39;Shades &amp; Peters&#39;, a pop/rock duo. The duo released their debut album in 2013. The album was recorded all over the world and featured numerous artists such as; Jim Cregan, Kevin Savigar, Jimmy Z, Tony Brock (Rod Stewart&#39;s legendary band from the 70s and 80s), Mickey Curry on drums (Bryan Adams band) and bass player Paul Bushnell.

Shades has for years been friends with the band members from Pretty Maids and joined the band in 2011. He previously played some gigs for them in 2004 but it was not until 2011 that he became a permanent member rocking the bass.  Big game players Thin Lizzy, Led Zeppling, Deep Purple and Queen are among influencers to Pretty Maids sound. Over the years, as a tribute, they have recorded cover songs from many of these influencers including their famous hit: A 1992 cover of John Sykes&#39; ballad Please Don&#39;t Leave Me.
Pretty Maids has been around for decades never failing to give its audience a solid performance everywhere they go. With more than 20 quality albums released they have proved to be in it for the long run. 

What shades finds most awesome about being a musician is touring. Playing on stage and kicking ass is his favorite activity. The size of the show is not an issue as long as he gets to deliver when on stage. 

When he is not busy giving his all to Pretty Maids and Shades &amp; Peters, Shades manages to write songs and produce. If there were more hours in a day he would probably add on more tasks. Shades is the kind of man who wakes up everyday appreciating where he is and providing both body and soul into his work. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Richard Fairbanks is the Emmy Award nominated owner of Pharoah Editorial in New York, where he works as a re-recording mixer, sound editor and sound supervisor on TV and film productions.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Richard Fairbanks&#39; mixing credits cover a wide range of areas from documentaries, musicals, live action and animated TV-series to corporate pieces and award winning radio plays. 

Fresh out of music school, Richard joined the staff at Chicago&#39;s old Universal Recording Studios, starting as a runner. He stayed and grew for a full decade before moving to New York. That decade and the huge variety of work it brought taught him things that are hard to learn any other way.

Richard is a huge fan of TC Electronic gear, and we got a chance to speak with him and hear more about his career and the gear he uses:

&#39;System 6000 initially found its way to my control room in 1999 or 2000, when I was looking for a Dolby Cat.43 noise reducer for dialog cleanup, having used them for years at larger facilities around town. Dolby had discontinued making them despite their popularity, and our New York distributor of Dolby products was unable to locate one. &#39;There is a new digital box from TC Electronic&#39;, he said, that has a Cat.43 emulation preset built in. Maybe you could take a listen?&#39; A day or two later we A/B&#39;d a System 6000 with a real Cat.43 and proved it could effectively match the Cat&#39;s noise reduction action, but there was so much more!&#39;

&#39;What seemed like hundreds of presets were available to load at the touch of a button. Transparent analog and digital IO, reverbs, delays, pitch shifting, dynamics, it was huge! I knew TC Electronic was a top flight company, so we bought one&quot;. 

&#39;I now use literally dozens of TC Electronic products. All of them run on my System 6000 MKII.&#39;

Richard is especially impressed with the multitasking capabilities of System 6000: &#39;A single engine, of which there are four, can provide very powerful A/B mono dialog paths with gentle noise reduction, superb de-essing of the most challenging material, EQ and notch filters, and multiband dynamics control on demand. With another three engines remaining, I can run room simulations and effects simultaneously to help shape overall tone and dynamics of the production dialog. Automation control is important, so in order to automate System 6000 MKII I use my DAW&#39;s MIDI facilities. Each System 6000 MKII engine can be assigned to a different MIDI channel. By recording the System 6000 MKII&#39;s MIDI output while adjusting parameters or selecting program changes, automation remains simple. &#39;

&#39;Projects such as up-mix of stereo elements into surround productions - in real-time during a final mixdown - is something I would never have considered before learning about UnWrap (which I recently updated to UnWrap HD).&quot; 

&quot;Since I first got it, System 6000 has played a role in nearly every project I&#39;ve worked on here and continues to do so, being anything from a simple program limiter to a primary component of my dialog chain.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Versatile rock guitar player Richard Fortus of Guns N&#39; Roses, currently touring with Thin Lizzy (2011) and Guns n&#39; Roses, is a sought after dedicated guitar player. Prior to joining Guns N&#39; Roses in 2002, Richard played with his band Pale Divine and toured as supporting act for Psychedelic Furs.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Richard Fortus joined the legendary Guns N&#39; Roses in 2001 and toured with the band in 2002, 2006 and 2007, handling both rhythm and lead duties. He also played rhythm guitar on a little record called Chinese Democracy, which you may have heard of, and the following tour in 2009-2010. Band leader Axl Rose describes Richard as &#39;an amazing lead player and a proven professional&#39;. We got a chance to speak with with Richard, who has been using TC Electronic gear for quite a while

TC: So, how did your musical career start?

Richard: &#39;My first band was called Pale Divine. We signed with Atlantic Records and put out one record with them. We toured supporting the Psychedelic Furs and during that tour, the Furs asked me to play with them. So I&#39;d join them onstage after my band&#39;s set. Then after that tour, the singer approached me about starting a new band with him. That band was called Love Spit Love. We did two records together and a lot of touring. After that, we put the Psychedelic Furs back together and did another live record and some studio tracks as well as a live DVD. I was also touring with different artists and mostly doing session work in New York City and I also had a company that did music for films, TV, ads and video games. I then joined Guns in &#39;02&quot;.
Richard is a firm believer in TC Electronic gear, which he uses both in the studio and live.

TC: What is your favourite TC Electronic gear?

Richard: &#39;The piece of TC Electronic gear that I use more than anything in the studio is the FireworX. What an amazing tool that is! There is nothing else like it. Very unique and very powerful. Very, very deep and unique. I also really really love G-System. My tech (Rock Davis), turned me on to them. I don&#39;t use it with Guns, but I use it as the heart of my smaller rig that I use for everything else. When I toured with Rihanna, I used G-System along with a couple of additional overdrives and used G-System to switch channels on my Egnater modular preamp. The main piece of outboard gear in my rack is G-Major 2. I&#39;ve been using G-Major&#39;s since I was in the Psychedelic Furs&#39;.
&quot;I began using the 2290 with my first band in the early 90&#39;s. It was THE delay to have!&quot; 

&quot;G-System has become a very valuable piece of gear for me. I&#39;m currently designing my pedal board for the Thin Lizzy tour around it. I&#39;m going to be using the Nova Drive pedal with it, as well as a vintage Univibe and a tape echo and compressor. Probably just one old Marshall head this time. I&#39;m really impressed with the Nova Drive. I&#39;ve got quite a collection of all the boutique overdrive pedals over the years. I&#39;m pretty amazed by how open and smooth sounding the Nova is and with the flexibility offered by integrating it with G-System, it&#39;s pretty unbeatable. TC Electronic stuff is laid out so intelligently and intuitively! Even the deepest units (like FireworX), make so much sense. You can go as deep as you want, but you don&#39;t have to always have the manual with you to program! The computer editing software for G-System is fantastic. It makes life so much easier! Absolutely brilliant piece of gear, I wish I&#39;d had this years ago! Would have saved me so many headaches and dollars! It&#39;s a genius command center for any gigging guitarist&quot;. 

TC: Can you tell us a little about your future plans?

Richard: &quot;I&#39;m currently scoring a movie and I am constantly employing Fireworx for ambient, sound-design layers. It&#39;s such an inspiring tool. I&#39;m heading out on the road with Thin Lizzy in May. It&#39;s such an honor to have been asked to do that gig. They were such a huge influence on me and have such a legacy of brilliant guitarists. It&#39;s just such an absolute thrill for me to work with them. How cool is it to get to play all of those harmony leads with Scott Gorham!? I&#39;ll then head back out with GnR after that. I know we have confirmed Rock In Rio and a few other shows and are currently scheduling more touring. God, how lucky am I?! Sure beats the hell out of working!&quot;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Richard Z. Kruspe is the lead guitarist of the German industrial metal band Rammstein. Since the early 90s, Rammstein has been a leading pioneer and a highly influential force within the metal genre, continuously pushing the boundaries and challenging the status quo whenever they can. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a child living in East Germany, Richard spent a lot of time in his room because he was grounded all the time. Richard explains: &#39;Music helped me escape and &#39;go somewhere else&#39;. Living in a country, where you couldn&#39;t go anywhere music gave me the freedom to &#39;travel&#39; in different countries.&#39; At the time Richard listened to a lot of 70s stuff: AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, and, later on punk and metal. After the Berlin Wall came down Richard became aware of the Californian funk-metal wave listening to bands like Faith No More, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Heads Up. Eventually he started getting more into industrial bands like Big Black, Ministry and Swans. Richard&#39;s first band was called Das Elegante Chaos (The Elegant Chaos), a punk band from a small town in the north of Germany. However, his desire to create his own music led him to form a funk metal band called Orgasm Death Gimmick. But Richard was never completely happy with being &#39;half&#39; into a &#39;California funk-metal vibe&#39;, and started thinking about doing something more &#39;German&#39;. Consequently a band was put together for a one-off show. As he was playing the songs, he realized where he wanted to go musically: to explore a combination of machines, rhythm and the roots of German and Western music in rock. There was nothing serious about it in the beginning - Richard and his band mates were just trying to combine things in a different way. Nobody at this point thought that it was going to be something as big as Rammstein.

Richard was a fan of show bands like Kiss, and show became a part of the concept from the very birth of Rammstein. &#39;Everyone in the band was interested in more than just the music. So we started out with small show gimmicks always trying to keep the balance between the music and the show. But sometimes we&#39;d go a little bit overboard and create more show than music&#39;, Richard admits.

Although Rammstein&#39;s lyrics are in German the still play all over the world for lot of people that do not understand German: &#39;You have to see it more like an opera. If you go to an opera language doesn&#39;t matter anymore. We try to create theatre, a visual show that people can see without having to rely on only lyrics&#39;. Richard Kruspe is a perfectionist when it comes to guitar sounds: &#39;I&#39;ve tried every preamp on the planet, every microphone and I have built my own studios. It&#39;s all about the room anyway - that&#39;s the secret if you want to create music.&#39; In his studio Richard is usually a lo-fi guy recording with real amps, cabinets and microphones. He has even invented a robot that changes the microphone position, to avoid running back and forth from the control booth to the recording room. When it comes to effects Kruspe is very open-minded: &#39;There&#39;s not one effect that I use in my sound. I&#39;m trying many different things to feel inspired and I&#39;m always really flexible and go into a lot of different effects to see what comes out. But when you get too much into the studio world and you spend a year trying out all those amps, preamps and microphones you forget writing songs. So I try to keep a balance about it and these days I concentrate more on writing than on sound&#39;.

As a result of Rammstein&#39;s elaborate live shows, Kruspe has opted for much of his effects rig to be handled sidestage by his guitar tech, Lutz Buch. Buch explains that the TC Nova Delay is used quite a lot as well as the Nova Dynamics, which is used for adding more compression and volume. The Nova Modulator, D-Two and PolyTune are also essential TC equipment that travel the world with Kruspe whilst he is on tour.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[The American guitarist and producer Rob Caggiano, born on the 7th of November 1976, is probably best known as the lead guitarist of the thrash pioneers Anthrax.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Before joining the rest of the gang in Anthrax in 2001, Rob played in a number of bands. Rob formed his first professional band Boiler Room in 1996 and later on, in 1999, he started playing in the band Orgy until they broke up in the summer of 2001, shortly after the release of their debut album.

Initially Rob played with Anthrax until 2005 as the band re-formed with the lineup from their 1987 album Among the Living. However, he rejoined the band later in 2007 at the end of the former reunion. Besides appearing on the albums We&#39;ve Come for You All, Worship Music, Greater of Two Evils and the live album Music of Mass Destruction, Rob was a part of The Big 4 tour during 2010 and 2011, of the back of their hugely successful 2011 album Worship Music. The tour was also hosted by three other bands that, combined with Anthrax, are generally considered the fathers of thrash: Slayer, Megadeth and Metallica. A live DVD of this tour was released on November 2nd, 2012.

Besides his astonishing talent on the guitar, Rob Caggiano is also known as a record producer under the alias Scrab 60. Along with various other well-known metal and hard rock bands, Cradle of Filth, Anthrax and Jesse Malin are amongst his most notable productions.

Also, Rob Caggiano is guitarist and songwriter in the band The Damned Things. Their debut album was released on December 13th, 2010 and was produced by Rob himself.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[5 times Grammy nominee Robben Ford is the premier electric guitarist of today. He is known for his excellent blues playing and ability to be comfortable in a variety of musical contexts. A magnificent blend of jazz and blues truly defines him as a guitarist. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Robben Ford is born in Woodlake, California in 1951. With a musical family it was virtually expected that he would follow in the footsteps of his father, mother and siblings. 
At age ten he began to play the saxophone as his first chosen instrument, which he kept on playing for a decade. When he was thirteen he taught himself to play guitar after hearing the two guitarists from The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Michael Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop.

First Ford played in &#39;The Charles Ford Band&#39; with his brothers Patrick (drums) and Mark (harmonica), a tribute band to their father. The band went on tour where Ford was picked up by Jimmy Whitherspoon (blues singer) and brought to L.A. Ford toured with Whiterspoon and was seen by Tom Scott and the members of the L.A Express. This lead to a promotional tour with Joni Mitchell and the L.A Express which formed his future musical life. 

Founding member of the Yellowjackets, while simultaneously having a solo career and working as a session guitarist, Ford had a busy plate. 
With his album &#39;Talk to your daughter&#39; (1988) he earned his first Grammy nomination, which became frontrunner for him touring under his own name for the first time.  
Ford returned to his roots in 1992 and seemed to find himself with the blues. He formed a new group &#39;The Blue Line&#39; and subsequently recorded some blues/rock albums that are among the finest of his career. 

An important and essential component in Ford&#39;s career is his passionate commitment to teaching. Passing on his personal experiences from the past 40 years to current and future musicians. His instructional videos and clinics over this time have culminated in collaboration with TrueFire and the birth of the Robben Ford Guitar Dojo. The wealth of his expertise and creativity is generously presented in these state-of-the-art productions.

Ford has had a long career collaborating with some of the best musicians such as Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, George Harrison and Kiss just to name a few. He has toured the world and shared his magnificent sound with the world.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[So, you&#39;re a successful bassist. You play in Ozzy Osbourne&#39;s band and have formerly been part of well-respected bands like &#39;Infectious Grooves&#39; and &#39;Suicidal Tendencies&#39;. Life is pretty good…]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[… Then, you get a call: &#39;Metallica is looking for a bassist... wanna try out?&#39; - and your life kicks into super-turbo-overdrive.

Well documented in the documentary &#39;Some Kind Of Monster&#39;, bassist Jason Newsted left Metallica in early 2001. Though it was clear to the world that things were askew in Metallica land, the news of Jason leaving still came as a shock, given his high-energy hard-hitting performances.

It was clear that Metallica were not ready to search for bassists right away and had some things to solve. It was simply a matter of four guys that got propelled into something that was no longer theirs - it belonged to the world. Like Newsted would later say, &#39;I saved Metallica by leaving&#39;.

In all of that, Robert came into view and met and performed with the band for the first time while the cameras for &#39;Some Kind Of Monster&#39; where rolling. Imagine the pressure! The remaining Metallica members, keen to avoid adding a bassist just to have one, took their time and made sure that Robert was the right fit. 
If you ever have the chance, check out &#39;Some Kind Of Monster&#39;. All the bassists auditioning are great players in their own right, but when Robert pops up during a montage of bassists running through &#39;For Whom The Bell Tolls&#39;, things just seem to &#39;fit&#39;. 

Another thing that is very clear is that Robert, although nervous, has tons of headroom and takes things in a calm and cool manner, with style. This has since helped him to deal with every challenge being in Metallica has thrown at him, from last-second setlist changes with obscure songs popping up, to dealing with the pressures of filling the shoes of the late Cliff Burton. Like Robert himself once said: &#39;you just take things as they come and hold on tight, because these guys move fast!&#39;

Since his inclusion, Robert has more than proven to fit the role of bassists in Metallica and has recorded 2 albums and one EP with the band (2008s &#39;Death Magnetic&#39;, 2011s &#39;Lulu&#39; with Lou Reed and Metallica and 2011s &#39;Beyond Magnetic&#39;, an EP with extra material from the Death Magnetic sessions). He is in many ways the guy that has truly saved Metallica and propelled them into the next stage of their existence. Another testament to Robert&#39;s dedication to the band is that he worked really hard on his singing and is currently able to harmonize with James Hetfield easily and provide authoritative backing vocals.

Robert prefers to play with his fingers instead of picks and mainly uses Warwick, Nash and Zon bass guitars - all strung with his signature Dunlop bass strings.

Fun fact: Robert has recently acquired the &quot;Bass Of Doom&quot;; A de-fretted mid-1960s Fender Jazz Bass that was formerly owned by the late Jaco Pastorius. Somehow it seems the torch has been passed on from one bass guitar genius to another.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Think of legendary bass players and Rocco Prestia features on every list. For over 40 years now Rocco&#39;s bass has been underpinning the groove for Californian funk legends Tower Of Power. In that time Rocco has defined his own style and become synonymous with the much-imitated &#39;Finger Style Funk&#39; that he pioneered back in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s.

&quot;I&#39;m proud I&#39;ve had a vehicle like Tower of Power to develop a personal style. A lot of cats - great players - never get that chance. They bounce around bands and sessions; they don&#39;t have the opportunity to cultivate a sound. So it&#39;s been an honor and a privilege to be able to grow both as an artist and as a player in this band. Thank God I happened to be in the right place at just the right time!&quot; In his time as both influential and legendary bass player, Rocco has tried just about all the gear there is to get the best sound possible and has always been striving for exactly that. Hearing rumours about a very different bass amp concept, &#39;Bass Amp 2.0&#39;, Rocco arranged to hear more about the RH450.

Rocco tried the RH450 rig prior to a Tower of Power sound check, and by the time he was through he&#39;d already made his mind up. His usual bass rig was instantly removed from the stage and the RH450 put in its place. Over the next few weeks the power, tone and clarity of RH450 grew on Rocco so much that he decided to take things a step further - and that&#39;s when the idea of the Staccato&#39;51 was born.

&quot;I&#39;ve always played the best amps in the world. Then TC Electronic took things to a completely new level with Bass amp 2.0. It&#39;s everything I want and need in an amp - the tone, clarity, durability, power… and the flexibility. So when TC asked me to combine their technology with my experience, I couldn&#39;t wait to get started. I&#39;m proud to introduce the result - Staccato&#39;51&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[&#39;Burn&#39;, &#39;Highway Star&#39; and &#39;Smoke on the Water&#39; are chart-toppers by world-renowned Deep Purple and Roger Glover is laying down the bass lines in this influential rock band. Roger is one of the true bass pioneers of rock and we are extremely proud that he is using our gear to spike his sound.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Roger started out in local band, The Madisons, but in 1969 Roger joined Deep Purple and was part of hugely successful albums like &#39;Deep Purple in Rock&#39; and &#39;Machine Head&#39;. Deep Purple is considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock and they have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. After four years in Deep Purple, Roger left the band and became a successful record producer for groups like Judas Priest, Nazareth and Elf. He also released two solo albums before re-joining with his former band mate, Ritchie Blackmore, as a producer for his solo project, Rainbow. In 1984, Deep Purple reunited and Roger returned to his old band - where he still plays today.

In his busy schedule, Roger still finds time to record and release solo albums, and in the beginning of August 2011, he released his fifth solo album &#39;If Life was Easy&#39;. One can only respect Roger&#39;s extraordinary and successful career both as one of the defining members of Deep Purple, but also as an independent record producer and songwriter.

We are extremely proud that Roger has decided to have our bass gear deliver the power and punch in the low end when playing stadiums and major venues all over the world with Deep Purple: &#39;The two RS410s delivered so much power, I was blown away. I normally use four times as much speaker space, but the TC Electronic rig delivered everything I needed,&#39; says Roger and continues.&#39;What particularly impressed me was the quality - firm bass, clean top and an overall roundness that gave me more body when I moved up the fretboard to the higher frequencies, something that has frustrated me over the years. Simply put, a superb setup. Fantastic stuff!&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Bass player and producer Roscoe Beck maintains the pulse, with a mainline to the blues.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Roscoe Beck first began to gain attention in the thriving blues and jazz scenes of Austin, Texas in the mid-1970&#39;s, creating a stir with his band Passenger, and in early collaborations with guitarist Eric Johnson.

In 1979, Passenger ventured to Los Angeles at the request of record producer Henry Lewy, and Roscoe soon found himself in a recording studio adding finishing tracks to Leonard Cohen&#39;s Recent Songs album. Tours followed in 1979/1980.

Shortly after the Leonard Cohen tours, Passenger disbanded and Roscoe moved to LA, landing the bass chair with the Toshiko Akiyoshi/Lew Tabackin Big Band and soon after embarking on what would become a decades long association with guitarist Robben Ford. Roscoe&#39;s Austin connection also continued to flourish, resulting in recordings and performances with Joe Ely, Eric Johnson, Omar and the Howlers, Jimmie Vaughan, and many others.

In 1986 Roscoe sat in the producer&#39;s chair for Jennifer Warnes&#39; highly acclaimed collection of Leonard Cohen songs, Famous Blue Raincoat, which sold over a million copies and made the Top Ten lists of both the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times. Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robben Ford, and members of Passenger all contributed to the much-celebrated recording. Collaborations with Cohen continued with Roscoe co-producing tracks on his I&#39;m Your Man album and serving as musical director for his 1988 tour.
In the years since, Roscoe has continued to perform and tour with a wide variety of artists, from long-time collaborators Eric Johnson, Robben Ford, and Leonard Cohen to the Dixie Chicks, singer-songwriter Darden Smith and guitarist Oz Noy. 

In 1995 Fender Musical Instruments honored Roscoe with the release of the Roscoe Beck Signature Bass, in four and five strings models. 

Roscoe&#39;s recent solo release Walk On, features guest artists James Cotton, Robben Ford, Kim Wilson, Neil Larsen. Eric Johnson, Omar Dykes, David Grissom, Mike Cross, Ruthie Foster, Greg Koch, Malford Milligan, and many others. Most recently, Roscoe released a two hour bass lesson (accompanied by Robben Ford) for the iPad app The Music Path
As a man who&#39;s dedicated his life to making remarkable music, and knows his way around quality gear, Roscoe uses TC&#39;s Corona Chorus and PolyTune; the RH750 bass amp and the RS210 and RS112 cabinets to faithfully reproduce his trademark sound.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[An American indie rock band, Band of Horses has spent the last nine years growing a remarkable fan base. With a combination of soothing melodies and personal, profound lyrics they found a style all of their own and made their way to the big scenes. Their debut Everything All the Time with the single &#39;The Funeral&#39; has hit the charts in Scandinavian countries and has been used numerous times in television, film, video games and advertisements.

The second album Cease to Begin made it to U.S. charts and Infinite Arms - the third album, was nominated for a Grammy award in the Best Alternative Album category. Mirage Rock is the latest album released by the Band of Horses.

Ryan Monroe plays a multi-instrumentalist role in Band of Horses, he plays guitar and keyboard, and used to be a drummer as a kid. Him and the lead singer Ben Bridwell grew up together, but it was not until 2007 when Ryan joined the band and became the permanent addition to at that time 6-piece band.

2012 was a significant year for Ryan Monroe, as he released his very first solo album - A Panting of A Painting On Fire.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Guitarist and singer-songwriter Ryan Roxie, born in California, currently resides in Stockholm, Sweden. He is the founding member of Roxie 77 and probably best known for his guitar work with Slash&#39;s Snakepit and legendary harbinger of rock and roll, Alice Cooper.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Ryan grew up in a small town called Pleasanton in the East Bay. With a father who played the trumpet, and a high school marching-band drum-bashing mother, Ryan was destined to venture down the psychedelic and artistic pathway of music. However, owing to a greater interest in beating down a drum kit, it wasn&#39;t until years later, at the age of eleven, that he really started getting into the rocking note shredding realm of the electric guitar. This autodidact musician learned the style of the guitar from listening to his father&#39;s dusty old recorder, forging his very own unique way of the instrument.

Besides Keith Partridge, who influenced Roxie at a quite early age, his influences cover world-known axe-wielding musicians such as Brian May, Eddie Van Halen, Steve Stevens and Rick Nielsen, to mention a few. Prior to the Alice Cooper ERA (starting in 1996), Ryan worked with Candy, Electric Angels, Dad&#39;s Porn Mag. He did extensive work as &#39;hired gun-man&#39; with various artists including Gilby Clarke, Tal Bachman, Bob Rock, James Michael and also wrote and recorded with Slash&#39;s Snakepit. Ryan Roxie&#39;s own band &#39;Roxie 77&#39; was formed in 2002 and has recorded two albums, &#39;Peace, Love and Armageddon&#39; released in 2004 and &#39;Two Sides To Every Story&#39;, which was only released as a download through the band&#39;s website during 2009.

When Ryan goes on stage he fancies bringing a true arsenal of our sparkling tone-twisting TC effect pedals. So, we seized this opportunity to sit down with Ryan in his own personal rehearsal studio in Stockholm. After hours of tweaking and twisting, we ended up with a set of cool and perfectly crafted TonePrints - a longer color- and atmosphere adding kind of echo sound for the Flashback Delay and a subtle, but thick, Leslie-effect type of sound for the Shaker Vibrato, mimicking the exact style of the string-bending phenomenon that is Ryan Roxie.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Scott Ian has helped pioneer the soaring sound of thrash metal band Anthrax with his crunchy guitar riffs. Over the last 30 years, he&#39;s worked on creating the &#39;New Wave of American Heavy Metal&#39; and has been a constant figure in the world of music, comics, poker, movies and television. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Born and raised in Queens, Scott Ian fell under the spell of Kiss early on and as a result, became interested in playing guitar. By the early 80s, he took to the new wave of the British heavy metal movement, looking up to bands like Mot&#246;rhead, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest. He was determined to form a band in that style and sure enough, more than 30 years ago, he founded Anthrax, a band that was to become a thrash metal icon alongside groups like Metallica, Slayer and Megadeath. 

The band&#39;s first release, 1984&#39;s &#39;Fistful of Metal&#39; brought on quite a following and Anthrax soon made a reputation as one of the world&#39;s top thrash bands on the strength of classic metal releases: 1985&#39;s &#39;Spreading the Disease&#39;, 1987&#39;s &#39;Among the Living&#39;, 1988&#39;s &#39;State of Euphoria&#39;, and 1990&#39;s &#39;Persistence of Time&#39;. 

Although they had set the norm for thrash metal, Ian and his band mates aimed to innovate and created two metal subgenres thought to be &#39;off-limits&#39; until then. They first broke down barriers and merged metal with hardcore in Ian&#39;s project called Stormtroopers of Death releasing masterpiece Speak English or Die. The second novelty was combining metal with rap in their groundbreaking collaboration with Public Enemy, &#39;Bring the Noise&#39; and &#39;I&#39;m the Man&#39;. 

The group&#39;s ensuing albums retained the band&#39;s loyal following especially due to their touring efforts - they&#39;ve been dubbed &#39;touring pros&#39;, having had over fifty tours worldwide, in thrity-two countries, on five continents. 

In 2009, Anthrax completed a run of European venues including Metallica&#39;s Sonisphere festivals in Germany and UK. A year later they returned to the same festival where for the first time ever the Big Four - Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeath -performed together on the same stage for seven historic shows.

Ian also plays guitar in a band called Pearl who just completed two tours with Velvet Revolver and Meat Loaf. In addition, he co-founded The Damned Things in 2010 with Joe Trohman and Andy Hurley of Fall Out Boy, Keith Buckley and Josh Newton from Every Time I Die and Anthrax band mate Rob Caggiano. In 2009 they released &#39;Ironiclast&#39;, a hard-rock album boasting influences from all three bands resulting into a fascinating medley: the melodic fetchiness of FOB, the heavy technical moments of ETID and the powerful riffing of Anthrax. 

Apart from focusing on Anthrax as full time career, Ian also made time to star in a 2001 VH1 television gig hosting &#39;The Rock Show&#39; and followed up with shows like &#39;Behing the Music&#39; and &#39;SuperGroup&#39;. He&#39;s also worked on DC comic series featuring their iconic character Lobo and has signed with Ultimate Bet to be one of their online professional poker players. Just recently, Ian and Anthrax have released their tenth studio album, titled &#39;Worship Music&#39; and have already started touring with a fully booked calendar for months to come.

TC Electronic caught up with Ian as he was preparing for a show, just before NAMM 2012 and got a chance to talk to him about his gear and his signature sound. We were honored to hear that our Classic Booster Distortion pedal has been part of his rough eclectic sound and his anti-gravity riffs ever since the &#39;80s. &#39;I&#39;ve been using TC since probably around &#39;82, &#39;83. I was using that booster distortion pedal when I first got my GCM800 back in &#39;82. The secret to my tone was that TC box. I used it to boost the signal going into the amp - it gave it the edge and the low-end and everything I needed without it being too fuzzy. It sounded so much better. &#39;, Ian explained.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Sean Michael Ray is the type of bass player that can produce pure, melodic, soul-stirring sounds that truly captures an audience.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Sean was born with music running through his veins. His mother is a holiness church organist and his father was a renowned bass guitarist. 

Although it is hard to believe, Sean has had no formal musical training. His first instrument was a trombone, but as he watched Soul Train, he came to the conclusion that the trombonist only played on portions of the song - he wanted to be a constant part of the music. Hesitant to get another instrument for her son, his mother said; &#39;Alright, I got you that trombone and now you want a bass. I hope you don&#39;t put that down!&#39; Now, more than 30 years later, he is still playing.

Inspired by Earth, Wind and Fire&#39;s bass player, Verdine White, Sean has traveled the world performing with such artists as Maxwell, John Waite, Gerald Albright, Alex Bugnon, Dionne Farris, Norman Brown, Joey Sommerville, Bob Baldwin, Sheila E. and Birmingham&#39;s own, Eric Essix.

He has also performed in various movies and soundtracks - among others: First Wives Club, Ghost of Mississippi, B5 (Hanna Montana Soundtrack - &quot;Shining Star&quot;), Dionne Farris - &quot;Truth About Cats and Dogs&quot;, Jonathan Butler and Juanita Bynum - &quot;Gospel Goes Classical&quot;, and John Waite - The Hard Way - &quot;Downtown Journey of a Heart&quot;. 
Though his travels have taken him far from home, he still returns to The Guiding Light Church on Sunday mornings where he has devotedly served for 24 years.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Star &amp; Dagger is a blues-rock/metal group made up of Sean Yseult, Dava She Wolf (Cycle Sluts From Hell) on guitar, and the sublime vocalist Von Hesseling. Their first album, recently released, is titled Tomorrowland Blues , and has received an much critical acclaim. Recorded at Rancho de la Luna, produced by Dave Catching and Ethan Allen, and mastered by J. Yuenger (White Zombie), the record was released through Megaforce Records. It was during recording at Rancho where Sean first discovered the TC Electronic RH40 and cabinets. She was so happy with the rig she used it for the entire recording.

 &#39;For me, the RH40 is all that I need - the sound coming from this tiny head blew me away the first time I played it! Loud, aggressive, powerful, and full clear tones - I love it. And for the first time, I don&#39;t have to ask someone to help me move my gear - that is one of my favorite things about the RH50. A lot of time we fly in for one-off gigs, and now I can bring my amp as easy as my bass!&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Sekou Bunch is an accomplished first-call session and touring player. Although primarily a jazz musician, Bunch has crossed over many genres of music during his career. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Over the last 35 years, Sekou Bunch has shared the stage and/or recording studio with such artists as Quincy Jones, Rod Stewart, Stevie Wonder, Roger Daltry, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, The Isley Brothers, Roberta Flack, Envogue, Anita Baker, Ray Charles, Chaka Khan, George Benson, Wayne Shorter, Marc Anthony, George Howard, Tom Browne, Lionel Richie, the Tonight Show Band, Kirk Whalum, Kevin Toney, Najee, Paul Jackson Jr. and Will Downing...just to name just a few.

Born and raised in New York City, Sekou Bunch was exposed to the arts from an early age. As a young child, Bunch showed great promise as a painter and dancer - both of which he pursued passionately.  Upon receiving his first bass around 1974, Bunch proved to be a quick study and soon began playing local gigs and jam sessions.  At age 17, Sekou teamed up with GRP artist, Tom Browne, whom he recorded with on the best selling funk classic LP &quot;Funkin for Jamaica&quot;, which awarded Sekou his first RIAA Certified Gold Record. Sekou also co-wrote the hit &#39;Thighs High&#39; with Browne.

Sekou eventually moved to Los Angeles, where his career picked up steam.  While based in LA, Bunch toured and recorded with the late George Howard and collaborated with producers Angela Winbush and Ronald Isley. Sekou was ultimately named musical director for the Isley Brothers, a position he held for eleven years. He also has the honor of also being coined a member of Quincy Jones&#39;  &quot;A Team&quot; along with session greats John Robinson, Gregg Phillinganes, Nathan East and Paul Jackson, Jr.

In 2005, Sekou had the pleasure of working on the Hurricane Katrina Tribute with Bebe Winans and the Tribute to Luther Vandross CD with Kirk Whalum and Lalah Hathaway.

In 2008, Sekou completed his album &quot;The Next Level&quot; featuring recording artists such as George Duke, Stanley Clarke, Boney James, Angela Winbush, Everett Harp, Sheila E., Rodney Franklin and several other major artists.

Sekou is also an accomplished actor with roles in &quot;Byrd&quot;, &quot;Coming to America&quot; and he has come full circle with &quot;Dreamgirls,&quot; having played bass in the orchestra pit at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway for the original stage production in 198. He also appeared in the 2006 film starring Beyonce and Jamie Foxx. 

Recently, Sekou has worked on a Michael Jackson tribute CD and several jazz albums. He is also releasing a book on electric bass studies and a compilation transcription book on hits he has played on.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Sharon Aguilar is an American instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter. She played lead guitar and violin with Scarlet Fever, the all-female backing band that toured with Cee Lo Green during 2010 and 2011. Convinced of her talent, Cee Lo green asked her to join his band permanently.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Sharon Aguilar currently plays in the original band Miss President consisting of members from the Cee Lo Green backing band Scarlet Fever. An accomplished and formidable guitarist, she attended the Musician&#39;s Institute in Los Angeles and is also a classically trained violinist.

Aguilar has amassed a wealth of television credits in the United States and abroad, having played on Saturday Night Live, The Today Show, Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Lopez Tonight, Good Morning America, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Last Call with Carson Daly, The Colbert Report, American Idol, Later … with Jools Holland (U.K.), VH1 Storytellers and Fuse TV&#39;s A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus.

With Cee Lo Green, she has toured extensively worldwide, including opening for Prince at Madison Square Garden, opening for the Foo Fighters at Wembley Arena, the March 2011 SoundClash show in Las Vegas with the Ting Tings and Goodie MOB, as well as many festivals and private shows in the US and abroad. As a songwriter, Aguilar co-wrote &#39;Rockstar,&#39; which appeared on Fefe Dobson&#39;s album Joy from 2010. The song was also heard on American Idol and the CW Television Network&#39;s Hellcats.
 
Aguilar&#39;s love affair with TC started after learning that it is the brand Guthrie Govan depends on to get his impressive tones.

For her drive sound, she chose the MojoMojo Overdrive: &#39;I have been into drive pedals of all kinds over the years and all of the other drive pedals I had all seemed to kill the bottom end. I can get a super silky tone with the MojoMojo and not only does it not kill the bottom end, it is not over-compressed and can still stand alone in a live mix.&#39;

&#39;I love the voicing switch on the MojoMojo. It feels so good when I pick. It is very responsive, and it is silky smooth. I can switch between two voicings that are very unique vintage drive sounds that keep all of the frequencies that I don&#39;t want to lose.&#39;

Aguilar needs her delay pedal to cover a lot of ground and chose the Nova Delay for this challenging task. &#39;It is probably the best stand-alone delay pedal on the market. I can&#39;t think of another delay pedal that size that can do everything the Nova can. Plus, it sounds so organic and smooth and it doesn&#39;t take anything away from your tone or color the sound in any way, that makes it feel awkward or overbearing.&#39;

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Simone started playing at an early age. &#39;Thanks to my father, I began playing the guitar at age 7,&#39; Simone says as he continues. &#39;When I was 12, I bought a bass guitar for two reasons - curiosity and to follow in the footsteps of one of my true musical heroes, Sting, and In 2008, I won the EuroBass Day (Verona, Italy) and was awarded &#39;Best European Bass Player under 35&#39; by a jury panel including extremely qualified bass players such as Matthew Garrison and Jimmy Haslip,&#39; Simone tells us.

Obviously, we also asked Simone about his gear. &#39;Well, for amplification, I use the Classic450 head which I find very comfortable, clean and powerful and also extremely versatile. As for the cabinets I use RS210 and RS212 and I think that this combination is the best you could ever have. The RS212 cab pushes very hard on the low frequencies whereas RS210 has a super fast response,&#39; Simone says and goes on to explain how he came about to use TC Electronic gear in the first place. 

&#39;During the European BassDay 2009 in Germany, I experienced TC Electronic bass gear in action for the first time, and I had already heard lots of great things about it. As a bass player I was obviously attracted toward the light and compact amp and cabinet design. One of the things I love the most about my rig is that for the first time, I am able to use compression. Usually, built-in compressors tend to alter the dynamics in an unpleasant way, but that is not the case with Spectracomp. Also, the EQ is voiced beautifully as it boosts and cuts all the right frequency areas, so you can make old-school sounds with the EQ combined with TubeTone as well as more modern types of sounds. However, if I should point out the single best thing about the rig, it would have be size, shape and weight. It might seem like a secondary point compared to the impressive technical features, but it for me, it actually turned out to be very important because it meets any need that I ever have regardless of whether I find myself on-stage in small clubs, or at really large venues - or anywhere in between.&#39;

Well, we&#39;re happy that Simone is enjoying his ride on the Bassamp 2.0 wave and rounded off the interview by asking him about his general view on music and what he has coming up in the near future. &#39;At the moment, I am very fascinated by the concept of looping,&#39; Simone tells us enthusiastically as he elaborates. &#39;I usually compose as any other songwriter, using a bass or a guitar. Then I follow a scheme, usually starting from the groove of my bass guitar, a bass drum playing the beat and ghost notes beating the accents. Next comes the looping, and once the atmosphere has been created, the rest comes naturally. During my live sets, I tend to use a DJ approach: it&#39;s like having two vinyl records playing together on different channels of the DJ-Mixing Console. Only, the great part is that the vinyl records did not even exist before until I created them on the stage!&#39; Simone says. &#39;As for the future, my main focus remains on my solo project, and the album (Going to the Next Level) I have just released . In short, my overall goal is simply to take my music anywhere it can go!&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Soren Andersen is a Danish guitarist, producer and songwriter, located in Copenhagen, Denmark. He works as a touring guitarist for Glenn Hughes and Mike Tramp. He does most of his productions in the Medley Studios, which he co-owns. He has worked with artists such as Artillery, Jay Nash and Baal]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[S&#248;ren Andersen was destined to become a musician. He grew up in a home stuffed with musical instruments, and at age 8, he picked up the guitar - he never let go! Right after grade school, S&#248;ren headed out for a career as a professional musician, and that&#39;s all he&#39;s been doing ever since. Today, he tours with Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple) and Mike Tramp (White Lion). Further, he has built up quite a reputation as a producer, and he is a co-owner of the &#39;Medley&#39; studio in Copenhagen where he has played with and/or produced for e.g. Marco Mendoza (Thin Lizzy, Straitjackets, etc.), Tommy Aldrige (Ozzy Osbourne, Gary Moore, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, etc.), Artillery, Oliver Weers and Jay Nash.

S&#248;ren is a heavy user of TC Electronic products, and we asked him exactly what he uses as well as how he came across those products in the first place. &#39;For my guitar rig, I use G-System, Nova System, Nova Drive, Octa Screamer and TC-Helicon&#39;s Voice Tone Create, and in the studio, I use TC Electronic&#39;s TDM Production Bundle for Pro Tools that includes the amazing reverb algorithms from System 6000 MKII,&#39; S&#248;ren says and continues. &#39;In my book, TC Electronic has always represented the best of the best, so I have always used lots of TC gear - from my Stereo Chorus Flanger pedal back in the 80&#39;s to my current Nova Drive. TC Electronic is also responsible for the fact that I find it almost impossible to play without presets today - they have simply become part of my performance. Part of the explanation is probably that I am also a producer as I put a lot of effort into making my guitar sound as &#39;correct&#39; live as it does in the studio. Whenever I switch sound, it needs to sound right - levels, no noise, no cuts of reverb or delay tails, etc. G-System and Nova System can do that, and that&#39;s why I love them so much! Also, I never mix an album without using TC Electronic reverbs as they&#39;re simply the best on the market!&#39;


We also asked S&#248;ren which functionalities he liked the best. &#39;Programmability,&#39; S&#248;ren says promptly. &#39;The programmable drive of Nova Drive and Nova System is unparalleled. Rather than having 3 drive pedals, I can do with just one and still have unlimited creative possibilities.&#39; Since S&#248;ren is to be considered a &#39;TC Electronic super user&#39;, we asked him if had any &#39;secret tips &amp; tricks&#39; that he&#39;d like to share. &#39;Yes, plenty!&#39; S&#248;ren replies. &#39;Solder a stereo jack connector to a potentiometer in a Cry Baby pedal to make G-System&#39;s Wah-Wah effect sound absolutely amazing. Another trick is to use Nova System&#39;s Pitch Block for Slap Delay effects, which will allow you to use both a long tap-tampo delay and a slap delay in the same preset. Finally, try using the compressor in G-System as a booster before a drive. Choose &#39;sustainer&#39; and set it to a slow attack and not too much compression, but plenty of level.&#39;

Finally, we asked S&#248;ren if he has a certain philosophy or approach to music in general and what he has coming up in the near future. &#39;Well, I consider every gig the last in my life! Never play like you don&#39;t really mean it - you never know who&#39;s in the audience! Also, I simply try to enjoy everything that music gives back to me, it is an essential anchor point in my life and it always will be. As for composition, if I have written a piece of music that I really like, it doesn&#39;t matter that much whether others like it too. And when it comes to producing music, I don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s such a thing as the &#39;correct&#39; mix. It&#39;s a matter of taste, so I just produce and mix music the way I like it, but I recognize that there are plenty of other solutions and that none of them are &#39;wrong&#39; or &#39;right&#39;. And the future? I leave for South America with Glenn Hughes in December, release a solo album in early 2011, go to NAMM in January 2011 and, finally, I have a summer tour around Denmark with Mike Tramp in the calendar!&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[From Alice Cooper to Sheila E and Huey Lewis to Vasco Rossi there is one constant in Stef Burns&#39; effects rack: TC Electronic!]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Stef Burns has been playing top level guitar for more than three decades alongside some of the biggest stars in the music world including Alice Cooper, Michael Bolton, Vasco Rossi, Huey Lewis and Sheila E. Here he tells us about the TC Electronic effects that he uses on the road and in the studio.

Indeed you could say that with the number of bands that Stef Burns has played in and also the wealth of top artists he has recorded with, it is a good job he started his career at an early age - in fact Stef started playing guitar at the age of six and was in his first band by 9! After playing in various acts doing covers he moved into the Jazz/Rock fusion arena before playing Funk in the band Omega at the start of the 80s. After a stint with Pablo Cruise he joined Sheila E&#39;s band and played on two of her albums: Romance 1600 and Sheila E. He was greatly influenced by Prince&#39;s funk playing and got to see it close up while playing with Sheila E and opening for Prince for his Purple Rain Tour. 

Stef then toured around the world with Berlin (who had a massive hit at the time with Take My Breath Away), and Michael Bolton. He also played in the bands The VU and Y&amp;T with whom he recorded four albums. The nineties saw Stef playing with Alice Cooper for four years and appearing on the Monsters Of Rock tour with Ozzy Osborne, Megadeth and Faith No More. Stef now regularly tours with Huey Lewis and the News and Vasco Rossi, an Italian artist who has released more than 30 albums and has become a huge star in Europe. 

With more than 30 years playing with the biggest names around Stef clearly knows his guitar gear, so it&#39;s no surprise to learn that he uses a lot of TC Electronic gear…

&#39;I love my G-Major 2,&#39; he says. &#39;It has all the rack effects I need - like, delay, reverb and stereo modulation - in one unit. It is also very easy to use, which is important for me because I don&#39;t like to spend a lot of time messing with gear when I can be playing, writing and recording. The sounds are wonderful and so clean and pure, something that TC always does so consistently. I like to use the harmonizer as well - I can get anything I want in any key for smart harmonies. And with my expression pedal I get great Whammy and Wha, so two less things to carry around.&#39;

&#39;I also use the TC Electronic Octa Screamer and I love it,&#39; Stef continues. &#39;I kick it in for some solos with my band [Stef Burns Group] and with Vasco and my tone soars up into a screaming high harmonic sound. Just killer! You can use it as a great fuzz with the Octa mix turned down or vice versa using your own distortion and just the high octave effect.&#39;

Finally Stef tells us about his TC Electronic Vintage Tube Primer: &#39;I love it. It has a natural overdrive without too much color. It is perfect for any live situation as well as in the studio!&quot;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Steffen Schackinger is a Danish studio guitarist, composer and performing artist. Inspired by Mark Knopfler and Jimi Hendrix, Steffen quickly made his mark on the Danish music scene, playing with different bands both in Denmark and abroad. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[&quot;The G-Major 2 has a vault of sophisticated effects but currently I mainly use G-Major 2&#39;s Delay section. Among other things this delay section allows me to use spillovers at preset changes. The Reverbs in G-Major 2 sounds excellent but for the ultimate Reverbs I&#39;m really happy to use the dedicated studio-reverb M3000&quot;

About Steffen
Steffen Schackinger was born right in the centre of Denmark - in the capital of the island Fyn - Odense. He started out on the violin as a kid, and moved on to cello and classical piano. With the classical and electric guitar he finally found his right instrument. 

At the age of 13 he started out as a band guitarist, and he soon earned a reputation, as an extraordinary guitarist. The young guitar player was invited to play with several bands. 

As a guitarist in &quot;Faber Band&quot; he was invited to sign his first record deal, and he decided to quit high school to concentrate on his music career. 

He joined the successful power rock trio MERZY, and became a real guitar hero. The band released several records and toured Europe. MERZY appeared as a supporting act for &quot;ZZ TOP&quot; and &quot;DEEP PURPLE&quot;, and at the time they were signed to Iceberg Records, BMG records and EMI Records in Europe and Asia. 

Along with the new millennium Steffen completed his education as a rhythmic guitarist at The Carl Nielsen Academy of Music, and the self-released cd with the band GRACELANDS - where Steffen sang the lead vocal and played guitar - got major airplay on the Danish radio stations with the songs &quot;Electrified&quot;, &quot;Climbing Into Space&quot; and &quot;Supersonic View&quot;.

From then on Steffen Schackinger has been recording countless of records as a session musician, along with being a theatre musician on several occasions. He also found himself in a bowtie playing with Symphony Orchestras as well as representing several guitar- and FX producers at guitar clinics. 

Steffen Schackinger started out as very young composer, writing classical songs. Now he is writing pop- and rocksongs as well as instrumental songs. For the past years Steffen has been focusing on ethnic music and been finding inspiration in both Irish folk music an Indian Rhythms. The Indian Sitar and the Bouzouki has been added to the list of instruments he&#39;s playing. 

Steffens guitarplaying contains elements from rock/hardrock, blues, jazz/fusion and country. He has found inspiration from several of the major guitarheroes - amongst others: Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Jeff Beck, Robben Ford, Joe Satriani, Allan Holdsworth, Frank Gambale, Bill Frisell, Van Halen, George Benson, Eric Johnson, Frank Zappa, Steve Morse, Steve Vai, Pat Metheny, Albert Lee, Paco De Lucia, John Mcloughlin and Larry Carlton. 

Furthermore the classic music and composers like Bach, Beethoven, Paganini, Stravinsky and not least Stephen Sondheim have had major influence on the musical development of Steffen Schackinger - as a guitarist and as a composer.

Steffen Schackinger recently joined the US label Candyrat Records, and released the album ElectriGuitartistry.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[The American singer, songwriter, record producer and guitar equilibrist Steve Lukather began his musical journey in 1976, at the age of nineteen, when he teamed up with his fellow musicians from the now legendary rock band Toto.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Lukather remained a part of Toto until the band split up in 2008 and also joined their reunion tour, when the band reformed in 2010.
 
Ever since his first solo record &#39;Lukather&#39; (1989), he has ventured into the various realms of progressive rock, hard rock and jazz fusion and collaborated with a vast number of notable musicians such as Eddie Van Halen, jazz guitarist Larry Carlton, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Steven Stevens. As of December 2011 Lukather began working on what will be his seventh solo album, scheduled to be released in 2013.

Inspired by guitar world Hall of Famers such as Jimi Hendrix and Jimi Page, Lukather is well-known for his ravenous and powerful playing style. This enormous musical talent combined with an incredible efficiency in the studio has earned this virtuous a total of five Grammy awards from a total of twelve Grammy nominations.

When it comes to engineering his personal sound, Lukather likes to keep it plain and simple - either it works or it doesn&#39;t. Although testing in studios offers a variety of technical tools to enhance and perfect your sound and style, Lukather praises the magic of the dynamics of performing live on the stage. He emphasizes these elements as a key factor of producing the perfect sound quality.

Lukather embraces the performance and high quality of TC products in general, and expresses that TC will always have a very special place in his personal setup.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Steve Morse is best known as the founder of the Dixie Dregs, and guitar player in Deep Purple since 1994. Morse&#39;s career has encompassed genres rock, country, funk, jazz, classical, and fusion.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Steve Morse is a true guitar legend. Period! He has been influencing guitarists all over the world since the 70&#39;s, and today, he stands out as one of the all-time-guitar-greats, who actually managed to stay at the forefront of rock guitar for nearly four decades. Steve started playing when he saw The Beatles play live on a TV-Show. He was floored, and he instantly knew that the guitar could play so many styles of music that he just had to learn how to play. So, he formed a band, playing covers of Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, Kinks, later on to Zeppelin and Cream, in which he became familiar with the basics of rock &#39;n&#39; roll guitar! In the 70&#39;s he co-founded the Dixie Dregs, and in the late 80&#39;s he joined KANSAS when they reunited. Since 1993, he has been a full-time member of the legendary rock band, Deep Purple, and on the side, he has been the bandleader of a number of solo projects as well. So, Steve is definitely &#39;still going strong&#39; - even after some four decades of touring, recording, performing and rocking! Impressive! 

We asked Steve which TC Electronic products he uses. &#39;Well, I have Nova Delay, PolyTune and my favorite - the new &#39;TonePrint&#39; FlashBack Delay,&#39; Steve says as he continues. &#39;I also have a bunch of vintage TC Electronic pedals. Back in the old days, a friend of mine gave me this really great delay to try out. It was just really well put together and well designed, but it was hard to find back then.&#39;
So, how does Steve utilize these pedals in his rig as well as during performances? &#39;The tuner is my stage tuner because it has true bypass, and it is fast and easy to read in the dark or with the stage lights up,&#39; Steve tells us. &#39;The delay, finally I have &#39;the one&#39;. It sounds great because I was allowed to customize it exactly to what I wanted, plus it can be configured to give a 100% wet output. This means, for me, that I can use it to feed my wet amp - the same way I used to use huge digital rack mount delays for. My main thing is the modulation on the delay. Everybody seems to have forgotten about this, and I&#39;m insisting that everybody tries my TonePrint preset and try and tell me that doesn&#39;t sound fantastic! My trick is to feed the delay from the effect send, but return it to a volume pedal, then to a separate wet amp... The delay has to be set so that there is no dry signal in the mix, which is no problem with the TC Electronic stuff. I have a box full of other pedals I&#39;ve bought to try out, and none of them will do this. When TC makes the next pedal that I&#39;ve asked for, I&#39;ll show you another neat trick that, again, nobody else is doing because none of the pedals give this capability. So, stay tuned!&#39;
Finally, we asked Steve about his overall approach to &#39;living music&#39; as well as what his future plans are. &#39;Well, my approach is to always try and please myself. I have no delusions that the music business will ever care what I do, so I have always been free to let my music be what it is without fear of rejection. People going to the shows have always fed me and my family, so the only constant I&#39;ve had in my life is follow my conscience,&#39; Steve says. &#39;As for the future, I&#39;ve got a lot going on, with a very special recording project with some great musicians that isn&#39;t quite finished. Plus, I&#39;m doing some guest recording, and an appearance on Sharon Isbin&#39;s classical recording. Oh, and Deep Purple never stops touring, so I&#39;m off soon!&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Steve Stevens is one of the most gifted guitarists to emerge from the &#39;80s music scene. Stevens picked up the acoustic guitar at only seven years of age and by the age of 13 he got his first electric guitar and was soon influenced by early progressive rock bands like Genesis, Yes and King Crimson.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[It was in the early &#39;80s that Stevens hooked up with ex-Generation X singer Billy Idol. Idol found the perfect partner in Stevens, and Idol&#39;s career skyrocketed, as he became one of MTV&#39;s early video stars spurred on by Stevens&#39; inventive guitar work and outrageous glam rock image. Stevens is well known for his use of a raygun sound effect in the Billy Idol song &quot;Rebel Yell.&quot;This sound effect was, according to a Guitar World interview created by using a toy ray gun held up to the pickups. Stevens now uses a toy ray gun equipped with a pitch bender and a repeat changer to produce the sound effect.

Later Stevens played on recordings by Michael Jackson, Ric Ocasek and Robert Palmer among others. Additionally, Stevens appeared on the mega-selling 1986 soundtrack to the Tom Cruise movie Top Gun which earned Stevens a Grammy Award for Pop Instrumental Performance that year.

By the end of the&#180;80s Stevens longed to launch his own solo career, and left Idol&#39;s band. He soon formed his own group, Atomic Playboys. The early &#39;90s saw Stevens keep up his busy schedule, as he formed a new group named Jerusalem Slim. Stevens then signed on to work with ex M&#246;tley Cr&#252;e singer Vince Neil on 1993&#39;s &#39;Exposed&#39; tour as openers for that summer&#39;s Van Halen tour. Numerous reviews stated that Steve was the best guitarist to grace the stage on many an evening.

Stevens finally got his chance to show off his lifelong appreciation of progressive rock when he united with bassist Tony Levin and drummer Terry Bozzio in the bombastic outfit &#39;Bozzio, Levin, Stevens&#39;, issuing a pair of releases: 1997&#39;s &#39;Black Light Syndrome&#39; and 2000&#39;s &#39;Situation Dangerous&#39;. Around the same time, Stevens reunited with Idol.

In 2008, Steve released the critically acclaimed instrumental album &#39;Memory Crash&#39; and in 2011, we will see Steve Stevens and Billy Idol celebrate a 30 year partnership that is stronger today than ever.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[In guitar, the order of technical prowess is: amateur - pro - virtuoso - guitar genius - Steve Vai. When it comes to technical skills, few have been able to come close him for the last 20 years.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[His unique voice, characterized by an esoteric, mystical approach to guitar and sounds has delivered some of the most stunning performances guitar has ever seen.

Equal parts technical prowess and amazing feel, Steve Vai has singlehandedly transformed guitar from a classic instrument to a modern weapon of mass awesomeness.

Steve is a guitarist incarnate - he worked with Frank Zappa, took lessons from Joe Satriani and attended Berklee College. Music is in his blood, and his creativity and outlandish tones match is fiery fretboard work. This also made a connection with music fans everywhere and Steve has sold over 15 million records.

In 1989, Vai joined Whitesnake, replacing Vivian Campbell. When Adrian Vandenberg injured his wrist shortly before recording was to begin for the album Slip of the Tongue, Vai played all the guitar parts. Vai played on the Alice Cooper album Hey Stoopid, along with Joe Satriani on the song &quot;Feed my Frankenstein.&quot;

Steve&#39;s unique and utterly stellar guitar playing has made him one of the most widely reckognized and revered guitarists in music, and his tunes have appeared everywhere from videogames to movies.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Ever prolific English musician Steven Wilson has been hard at work at various musical projects, amongst others Porcupine Tree, over the last couple of decades, playing guitar as well as several other instruments while trying out different musical genres.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Steven Wilson has been exploring sonic expressions almost from the get-go. Heavily influenced by a musical diet consisting of his parents&#39; records, especially Pink Floyd&#39;s The Dark Side of the Moon and Donna Summer&#39;s Love to Love You Baby. Wilson has later noted that listening intensely to those two records as a child has had a defining influence on his musical expression. 
At the tender age of eleven Wilson got hold of a classical guitar and started playing around with its sound qualities, moving on to studio recording at age twelve when his father gave him a multi-track tape machine and a Vocoder. 

Since those early days, Wilson has tried on many different musical clothings such as heavy prog, psychedelic, post-rock, electronica, drone, ambient music, metal and art rock. Most well-known for prog rock band Porcupine Tree, Wilson has also released music under names such as No man, Bass Communion, Incredible Expanding Mindfuck, and Blackfield, to mention a few. 

The year 2008 marked a change, seeing Wilson release his first album in his own name. The 2008 album, Insurgentes was followed by Grace For Drowning in 2011, which showcases Wilson&#39;s dedication to the album format, containing two cd&#39;s.

As if that wasn&#39;t enough, Wilson has also had his fingers on the buttons in the studio, becoming heavily interested in high-quality sound recording, which has given him a following among audiophiles. Therefore, it&#39;s an honour that Wilson has chosen to turn to TC Electronic. Wilson states on using the TC Electronic G-System: &quot;My music requires a huge amount of different sounds and textures from the guitar, and this would normally involve a lot of different boxes and pedals. At the same time I&#39;m a great believer in keeping things clean and simple on a long touring cycle, and the G-System has solved this issue perfectly, and been the centre of my whole setup for more than 5 years. It&#39;s been reliable, and proved easy to use and program on the fly, with quality effects, plus it also allows me to loop in 4 of my favourite pedals seamlessly. I can&#39;t imagine working without it.&quot;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Sune Rose Wagner is the songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist for noise pop duo, The Raveonettes. He has been a member of three successful bands, had twice as many albums figuring on the US Billboard Top 200 and scored a 2 million $ recording contract with a major label before turning 40.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[At the age of 15 Sune Rose Wagner formed the band &#39;Western Front&#39; that by 1992 had evolved into &#39;Psyched Up Janis&#39;. After three album releases the group split in 1999. After playing for a while in &#39;The Tremelo Beer Gut&#39; he formed his most successful band &#39;The Raveonettes&#39; with fellow Dane Sharin Foo.
 
The Danish indie rock duo combines pleasant two-part vocal harmonies with rough electric guitar sounds and considerable quantities of noise. Although the music is reminiscent of the careless rock of the &#39;50s, there is a concurrent malicious texture to it, produced by the often obscure thematic of the lyrics (lust, use of drugs, suicide).

The duo met in Copenhagen and recorded their debut album, &#39;Whip It On&#39;, in 2001 with contributions from guitarist Manoj Ramdas and jazz drummer Jakob Hoyer. After releasing their debut album on the influential Danish Crunchy Frog label the band made quite an impression on Rolling Stone editor, David Fricke, at the Danish SPOT festival in Aarhus. Fricke&#39;s positive review of the duo immediately resulted in a number of offers from major labels. A bidding war for the band started and culminated in a $2 million contract with Columbia Records in 2002.

&#39;Whip It On&#39; was named &quot;Best Rock Album of the Year&quot; at the Danish Music Awards in 2003, and in the same year Rolling Stone and Q Magazine proclaimed the group one of the forerunners of the &quot;Next Wave&quot; of contemporary music.

The band&#39;s first full-length album, &#39;Chain Gang of Love&#39;, was recorded in Denmark and in New York and is notable in that all the songs are in the key of B-flat major. Anders Christiansen (bass, percussion, organ) joined in for the recording of the follow-up album, &#39;Pretty in Black&#39;. The album featured guest vocals from Ronnie Spector of The Ronettes as well as guest instrumental spots from Maureen Tucker (The Velvet Underground). The duo&#39;s third studio album, Lust Lust Lust, was released in November 2007 in Europe and February 2008 in the U.S. The album received positive reviews. 

In December 2008, Sune Rose Wagner released a solo album, simply titled &#39;Sune Rose Wagner&#39;. All of the songs are sung in his native language of Danish.
 
The Raveonettes&#39; fourth album, &#39;In and Out of Control&#39;, was released in October 2009, with &quot;Last Dance&quot; as the lead single. &#39;Raven in the Grave&#39;, The Raveonettes&#39; fifth album, was released in April 2011 and has produced three singles to date. 
The duo released their latest album, titled &#39;Observator&#39;, in September 2012, following the release of the two singles &#39;Observations&#39; and &#39;She Owns the Streets&#39;.

During live performances Sune Wagner uses a number of Jazzmasters. In the studio he also uses other types of Fenders besides several Gibsons, and Gretsches.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Tal Wilkenfeld is a musical marvel; the kind of dynamic young talent whose fresh vision and uncanny intuition puts a whole new perspective on an age-old art form.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Like a muse-lit meteor, Tal blazed onto the music scene as a teen, sitting in with the Allman Brothers within months of her 2006 arrival in New York City. By the end of 2007, she had released her acclaimed, instrumental debut, Transformation, and hit the road with Chick Corea. Tal went on to appeared on A&amp;E with Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter, then joined Jeff Beck&#39;s world tour for what culminated in her global breakout moment. Her performance at Eric Clapton&#39;s 2007 Crossroads Festival in Chicago, which has generated more than 10 million plays on YouTube.

Unanimous praise reverberated throughout the industry, leading Tal to relocate to Los Angeles and begin a steady recording pace with such artists as: Prince, Macy Gray, Trevor Rabin, Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Ringo Starr, Brian Wilson, Toto, Todd Rundgren and Ryan Adams— all happening in-between high profile tours with Jeff Beck that found her backing guests like Sting, Clapton, Jimmy Page, Mick Jagger, Steven Tyler, Buddy Guy, David Gilmour. Plus, Billy Gibbons, which led to her role anchoring Pharrell and Hanz Zimmer on the 2015 GRAMMY Awards. Ever the growing artist, Tal&#39;s collaborations with Jackson Browne and encouragement from Jeff Beck and Herbie Hancock to make her live vocal debut with their bands served as key transitions to her next path as a singer-songwriter. Stellar singing samples include her poignant cover of &#39;All I Want for Christmas Is You,&#39; from the Amazon holiday collection stream, All Is Bright, and her stirring YouTube channel performance of &#39;Chelsea Hotel.&#39;

Tal will be releasing two new singles - &#39;Corner Painter&#39; and &#39;Haunted Love&#39; - this Spring 2016 in support of her first, forthcoming headline tour, and her North American shows opening for The Who. The new music is an intoxicating, intimate reimagining of the singer-songwriter idiom. The singles are comprised of improvisational sonic bloodlines, rock energy and intensity, and lyrics rich in both realism and folk symbolism—all delivered by Tal&#39;s vibrant, revealing vocals and with her world-class musicianship.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[One of the nicest guys in  show business, Tom Hamilton, holds down the low end in the hard rock/blues rock band Aerosmith and has even co-written 2 of their greatest hits: &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and &quot;Janie&#39;s Got a Gun&quot;.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[This hard rockin&#39; bass wielding musician was born Thomas William Hamilton, on December 31, 1951 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The first time Tom picked up an instrument, he was around 12 years old, and influenced by his older brother Scott. Although he originally started out playing guitar he soon ditched his six-stringed instrument in favour of its four-stringed and slightly bigger brother - the bass guitar.
 
Before joining up with Steven taylor, Ray Tabano and Brad Whitford, Tom played with soon-to-be Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry in a couple of bands, one of witch was simply called &#39;The Jam Band&#39;. It wasn&#39;t until 1970, during a gig with &#39;The Jam Band&#39; that the original Aerosmith lineup fully assembled by teaming up with Joey Kramer as the final member. Referred to as &#39;America&#39;s Greatest Rock and Roll Band&#39; and &#39;The Bad Boys from Boston&#39;, Aerosmith has come to be one of the best selling American rock bands, having sold more than 150 million albums worldwide. Their repertoire holds a vast psychedelic palette of award winning records - their latest album being the &#39;Music from Another Dimension&#39; album that was released on November 6, 2012.
 
Tom Hamilton holds a very special arsenal of bass guitars. His first ever instrument was a Fender Precision and throughout his career in Aerosmith the Fender Jazz Bass, a modified &#39;51 Fender Precision Bass with double pickups, Music Man, Gibson Thunderbird and a variety of the Rodger Sadowsky bass guitar models have all been a part of his personal instrumental wardrobe - just to name a few.
 
When touring with Aerosmith, the Stereo Chorus pedal and the G-Major 2 multi effect processor are holding very special places in Tom&#39;s Bass rig. His personal bass tech Aidan Mullen praises these very products as the best sounding, most versatile and most reliable tools on the market: &#39;The TC folks have always been there for me and I try to be there for them - great sounding stuff!&#39;.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Tommy Stinson is best known as the spiky-haired charismatic bass player of legendary garage punkers the Replacements and a bass player for Guns N&#39;Roses.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[What makes Tommy Stinson so unique is that he was not interested in music as a child unlike a lot of musicians. He was pushed to play bass guitar by his brother, who believed that Tommy needed to occupy his mind with something rather than getting in to trouble all the time. Tommy&#39;s interest in jamming on bass unfortunately did not pick up right away, so Cokes and candy bars were offered as a bribe until he played his first gig on a stage. Realizing that this could actually bring fame on stage and amongst women, he then became interested in playing a bass.
Tommy, his brother and other band members assembled a band called The Replacements and Tommy&#39;s career as a bassist started. The Replacements, who deservedly earned a title of alternative rock pioneers, had occupied the scene for more than 10 years.  
During that time the band released several albums including their debut album &#39;Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash&#39;, &#39;Stink&#39; and &#39;Let It Be&#39;.
In 1992 Stinson formed a group called Bash&amp;Pop and released the album &#39;Friday Night is Killing Me&#39;, which according to rumors was recorded only by Stinson featuring various artist. The album, however, had gotten mixed reviews.
Once again Stinson formed a group called Perfect where he switched to bass and played there until the group broke up in 1998.
However, Stinson was not out of scene too long as the same year, he was invited to join Guns N&#39;Roses and as a bass player and remained in the band up to this day.
His bass playing is featured on the Guns N&#39;Roses album &#39;Chinese Democracy&#39; that was finally released in 2008 after being delayed for a long time.
Besides being a bass artist in the worldwide known band, Tommy had released his own solo album, something that had been on his &#39;to do &#39; list since 1990 and started recording the album in 2003 in collaboration with Phillip Broussard.  The album received positive reviews from music critics and fans.
In addition, Tommy joined the band Soul Asylum in 2005 and toured with them until last year, where he was eventually replaced due to the lack of his availability. 
His second album &#39;One Man Mutiny&#39; was released in 2011.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Sometimes it takes a tragic life event to happen to realize ones true potential and Tony understands that like no one else. Due to a horrific accident, at age of 18, Tony was left homebound with a broken back.

To keep himself busy during recovery time, Tony picked up a bass guitar and did not let it go since! He ended up getting a scholarship at Berklee College of Music in Boston and graduating with a prestigious &#39;Outstanding Performer&#39; award. 

During his time in Berklee he formed a band called Bliss, which signed a major record deal with a legendary record producer Terry Ellis. Eventually, Tony left the group to continue his studies at Berklee and from then on started his own solo career. The first record Moving was released in 2004, four years later Chasing Shadows and in 2010 Unknown Angels. Grey&#180;s new album Elevation is due for release in October 2013.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Tony Iommi is one of the most influential guitarists around, he benchmarked a new standard for heavy metal and generated some of the most epic and recognizable guitar riffs in rock history.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[In spite of a tragic accident in the early years where Tony lost the tips of the fingers, he still achieved massive and well-deserved recognition as the most influential heavy metal guitar player as a member of Black Sabbath. In fact, losing the tips of his fingers on his fretting hand is what shaped his unique sound, resorting to light string gauges and down tuning. 

Tony&#39;s interest in music began when he was just a teenager. Hank Marvin &amp; the Shadows influenced a young left-handed boy to play guitar, which through the years unfolded into an international career. It all started with a band called Earth that Tony assembled with his school buddies Terry &#39;Geezer&#39; Butler, Bill Ward and John &#39;Ozzy&#39; Osbourne. The band changed their name to Black Sabbath, and soon became a blueprint for hundreds of others that followed. 

Black Sabbath shook up the heavy metal scene with dark lyrical subjects, distinctive riff based music and dark and haunting sounds.  That led into successful all time classic releases such as &#39;Black Sabbath&#39;, &#39;Paranoid&#39;, &#39;Master of Reality&#39;, &#39;Vol. 4., &amp; &#39;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&#39;, putting them on the map as the worlds top hard rock band.  

The band hit a rough patch in the late 1970&#39;s that consequently led to Ozzy leaving but they bounced back with singer Ronnie James Dio recording more classics - &#39;Heaven &amp; Hell&#39; and &#39;Mob Rules&#39;. The original lineup subsequently reunited for a number of tours and earned a Grammy award for the track &#39;Iron Man&#39; from their &#39;Reunion&#39; album.  

Tony kept a solo career going with two stand-out albums - &#39;Iommi&#39; and &#39;Fused&#39;, plus the highly regarded &#39;The Devil You Know&#39; with Dio and Butler under the band moniker Heaven &amp; Hell.  In 2011 the original Black Sabbath line-up began work on a new album, &#39;13&#39; which was released in June 2013.  No sooner had they started than Tony was diagnosed with lymphoma but despite receiving treatment he continued to record and the result gave the band their first US number 1 as well as number 1&#39;s in the UK, Canada, Germany, Sweden, etc.

In 2013 the band will tour the world going to Asia, North America, South America and Europe.   ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Trey Gunn is an American musician, known for his membership in progressive rock band King Crimson from 1994 to 2003.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Trey&#39;s interest in music grew through various instruments: electric bass, electric and acoustic guitar, keyboards, and the touch guitar. He moved to Eugene, Oregon, and played in punk bands while he completed a degree in classical music composition at the University of Oregon. He then moved to New York City where his professional career began.

He spent some time as a student of Guitar Craft with founder Robert Fripp and appeared on several Robert Fripp and the League of Crafty Guitarists recordings. From 1988 to 1991, he toured playing Chapman Stick in the UK and Europe, with Toyah Willcox, Robert Fripp and Paul Beavis, at first under the band project name &quot;Fripp, Fripp&quot; who by the second tour became &quot;Sunday All Over the World&quot;. They recorded and released one album in 1991 entitled Kneeling At the Shrine. In the same year and with the SAOTW line up, he also played stick on the solo Toyah album Ophelia&#39;s Shadow, produced by Toyah who was to later guest on his album, The Third Star.

In 1992, he was asked to join David Sylvian and Robert Fripp in a collaborative project that toured the United States, Europe and Japan. The band released The First Day and Damage — a live recording from the Royal Albert Hall in London. During this period Gunn also recorded his first solo album One Thousand Years.

In 1994, Gunn joined King Crimson. With King Crimson he played Chapman Stick and subsequently diverse types of Warr guitar and was part of the &quot;double trio&quot; formation opposite Tony Levin. In 1997, King Crimson fragmented into smaller configurations known as the ProjeKcts. Gunn, along with Fripp, participated in all of the ProjeKcts performances and recordings.

 In 1999, the group mutated into a four piece — Belew, Fripp, Gunn and Mastelotto. He left Crimson after &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; tour in 2003. Over the course of his decade with the group he participated in thirty-three King Crimson CDs, two DVDs and hundreds of performances.

He has also performed and recorded with a number of other musicians: Tool, Puscifer, Robert Fripp, Sean Malone and Gordian Knot, David Sylvian, Vernon Reid, John Paul Jones, Eric Johnson, Italian singer Alice, Azam Ali, Matt Chamberlain, Michael Brook, Bill Rieflin, David Hykes of the Harmonic Choir and many more. He has released a number of solo albums, as Trey Gunn and as the leader of The Trey Gunn Band.

Years of working with broad-necked instruments like the Warr guitar affected Gunn physically and he had to seek less abusive outlets for his artistic expression. In 2003, Gunn founded the multi-media group Quodia with Joe Mendelson where he contributed more vocals than in previous projects and less Warr guitar. In 2004, he and Pat Mastelotto started collaborating with Kimmo Pohjonen and Samuli Kosminen, forming KTU out of their respective duos TU and Kluster. In 2007, he began working with Eddie Jobson in the group UKZ.

In addition to helping run a collective music label based in Seattle called First World (FWD) and a multimedia production company (7 Directions), he is currently dividing his time between his solo work, film and television scoring, music supervising, and building multi-dimensional media projects.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Troy Sanders rocks the bass lines and vocals in the hugely successful American heavy metal band, Mastodon, which is famous for their hard-rocking riffs, psychedelic multi-layered songs and great melodies.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Mastodon was formed in 1999, after the members discovered a common passion for sludge metal and hard rock. Over the years, Mastodon has released extremely memorable and critically appraised records like &#39;Remission&#39;, &#39;Leviathan&#39;, &#39;Blood Mountain&#39; and &#39;Crack the Sky&#39; - of which the latter has sold over 200.000 copies in the US alone. At the time of writing, the band is putting the final touches on its next album &#39;The Hunter&#39; which is hitting the streets in September 2011.

&quot;I&#39;m rocking the Blacksmith every night - It&#39;s killer&#39; says Troy. We are proud to deliver the massive sound Troy needs to smash up the stage with his monster band, Mastodon.&quot;POWER, WARMTH, CLARITY &amp; DRIVE!&quot; are the four powerful words Troy uses when he is asked to describe the Blacksmith. Further, Troy and his techs were so pleased with the Blacksmith and its warm sound that Troy decided to use it on Mastodon&#39;s new album, &#39;The Hunter&#39;. 

This summer (2011), Mastodon rocked the main stage at Roskilde Festival in Denmark and we got the opportunity to meet Troy for a quick chat about our bass gear and Mastodon&#39;s coming album &#39;The Hunter&#39;.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Troy Dean Van Leeuwen began playing music at a young age and started playing guitar at age 13. He soon became a sought after session player, which later led him to join such legendary rock bands as A Perfect Circle and Queens of the Stone Age.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[US musician and producer Troy Van Leeuwen first picked up a guitar nearly 30 years ago and soon honed his craft in many bands including Failure and 60 Cycle. But is was his skill as a session musician that led to a very high profile outing with supergroup A Perfect Circle with Maynard James Keenan and Billy Howderel. Troy played on their huge debut album Mer De Norms which got to number four in the Billboard 200. He also played on three tracks on the band&#39;s second album Thirteenth Step but a successful audition then led to him joining Queens Of The Stone Age. He famously had to learn 30 songs in a week before heading out on a major tour with them in 2002 after the release of their third album Songs For The Deaf. 

Troy&#39;s been with Queens Of The Stone Age ever since, playing on their Gold-selling album Lullabies To Paradise and 2007&#39;s Era Vulgaris. The band have built up a big following thanks to their sell-out performances around the world that have also included some huge festival appearances. Troy also plays in Sweethead, whose self-titled debut album came out last year. He uses a range of gear from TC Electronic, TC-Helicon and Dynaudio. In fact why don&#39;t we let him fill us in…?

&#39;The set up I use depends of what project I&#39;m working on,&#39; he reveals. &#39;With Sweethead I am the only guitar player so sonically I have to cover a lot of ground. That means lots of processing, MIDI capabilities and stereo imaging for both guitar and vocals. For Queens Of The Stone Age the use of ambience and the color of sound is what I focus on. So the set up I use is always evolving. And TC Electronic always seems to be a part of this ever changing experiment that is my sound.&#39;

&#39;I&#39;ve been using TC Electronic gear for years,&#39; he continues. &#39;My first TC pedal was a Boost/Line Drive Distortion pedal. In studios I would always use the 2290 for delays and doubling and in my home studio I use two TC PowerCores in my Mac and a FireworX for processing. On the road my main effects processor for guitar is the G-Force, the Nova Reverb pedal and a TC-Helicon VoiceLive2.&#39;

That sure is a lot, so what is it that led him to choose so much TC gear? 

&#39;TC Electronic is a company that&#39;s been around for decades and the quality has always been consistent,&#39; he replies. &#39;Most of the time I use gear not just for the sound but for the durability out on the road. And on the road, things usually break. Every piece of TC gear I own has lasted throughout my years as a touring musician.&#39;

And it&#39;s a good job that he finds it so durable because Troy has some interesting ideas when it comes to actually using the gear…

&#39;My philosophy with gear is to abuse it, push it, make it scream and occasionally spill wine on it,&#39; he says. &#39;So I&#39;ll use the PowerCore Tubifex plug-in for drums. The sound of the G-Force is really designed for guitar or bass because the effects can sound like pedals if you want them to but I also use it on vocals. And the VoiceLive 2 can compete with any studio multi-effects processor in the studio as well as live and I even use it on keys. As long as the meters are pinned in the red it&#39;s doing what I want.&#39;

And as Troy is using the gear he finds that TC have made it very easy to use and abuse it…

&#39;It&#39;s easy to dive into the features of all of the units I use,&#39; he says, &#39;and yet there are depths to be explored if I choose. The G-Force, for instance, has endless routing combinations just in case you want to put an auto-wha filter after a reverb in series or parallel and then distort the left side of the mix.&#39;

Finally what does Troy have planned for the future?

&#39;Near future plans are for Sweethead to be touring and promoting our debut record in North America, Europe and the UK starting this spring and throughout the summer. There are some loose plans for Queens Of The Stone Age to do some shows in the fall and start recording a new record shortly after. But there&#39;s always a plan to create music.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

											<youtubeDescription><![CDATA[El BH250 es Potente de verdad, y muy  Ligero, &#161;compru&#233;belo! &#191;Qu&#233; m&#225;s necesita? Combine este amplificador con una o m&#225;s cajas de bocinas y tendr&#225; un equipo de bajo flexible y con una tecnolog&#237;a extraordinaria y s&#250;per inspiradora. Sencillo de usar pero nada simple en su interior. Sencillo en cuanto a su aspecto y su funcionamiento cada vez que lo ponga en marcha. Use los mandos Bass, Middle y Treble, como har&#237;a en cualquier otro amplificador, pero marav&#237;llese ahora con el dise&#241;o y
el esfuerzo que hemos dedicado al comportamiento final de estos controles. Distintas zonas de frecuencias se ven afectadas con el realce y la atenuaci&#243;n para hacer que todo suene &quot;justo de la mejor forma posible&quot;.
Afinador para bajos de 4-6 cuerdas, salida balanceada con selector Pre/Post EQ, salida de audifonos y entrada para la conexi&#243;n de una fuente stereo como un iPod... en fin, mucho m&#225;s de lo que uno podr&#237;a esperar, pero... &#191;por qu&#233; no esperar m&#225;s a&#250;n?

TonePrints  para su amplificador de bajo. Y eso &#191;qu&#233; es? El BH250 ve la luz con un efecto Chorus en su interior y con el mando TonePrint que le permite a&#241;adir la cantidad de efectos que quiera. &#161;Pero el chorus es solo el efecto predeterminado! Desde la p&#225;gina web de TC Electronic podr&#225; descargarse y probar un flanger, vibrato, saturaci&#243;n o compresor. Evidentemente, todos los efectos est&#225;n configurados especialmente para el bajo. &#161;Pero eso no es todo...! Algunos de los mejores bajistas del Mundo han puesto a su disposici&#243;n algunos de sus sonidos personalizados para que pueda usarlos. Estos TonePrints son cargados en el amplificador usando un cable USB y un ordenador o a trav&#233;s de la incre&#237;ble App TonePrint desde la mayor&#237;a de smartphones.

El BH250 es un amplificador Altamente recomendado!]]></youtubeDescription>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Victor Wooten redefines the word musician. Five time Grammy Award winner, three times Bass Player of the Year winner and acclaimed as one of the Top Ten Bassists of All Time by Rolling Stone Magazine, Victor Wooten is an idol to many musicians.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Bass generally is not considered a solo instrument, but when Victor Wooten picks it up, he proves everybody wrong and shows that, in fact, it can be an awesome solo instrument! What is interesting about Victor is that he was taught by his older brothers to play music from the age of two and at the age of five was already performing with them in their family band The Wooten Brothers. 

At six he was on tour with his brothers opening shows for legendary soul artist Curtis Mayfield. In 1988 Victor moved to Nashville, TN where he worked with singer Jonell Mosser and met New Grass Revival banjo ace Bela Fleck. A year later, Fleck enlisted Wooten to perform with him on a television show and Bela Fleck and the Flecktones were born. After three highly successful albums, the band became a trio, which enabled Victor to develop and display a staggering array of fingerboard skills that turned him into a bass hero of Pastorian-proportions and helped earn the band 5 Grammy awards. As the &#39;90s progressed, Wooten added a solo recording career and numerous collaborations to his duties in the Flecktones. Along with solo albums like 1996&#39;s A Show of Hands and the following year&#39;s What Did He Say?, Wooten contributed to albums by friends such as India Arie, Dave Matthews Band, Paul Brady, and Branford Marsalis&#39; Buckshot LeFonque.

His third solo album, Yin-Yang, which featured appearances by Fleck, Bootsy Collins, and the Wooten Brothers, was released in 1999. Live in America from 2001 documented four years on the road in a double-disc package. After tours with the Flecktones and a 2001 release/tour with the group Bass Extremes, Wooten returned to his solo career in 2005 with the album Soul Circus.
Released in 2008, Palmystery included guests performances by drummer Dennis Chambers, guitarist Mike Stern, Howard Levy on harmonica, and many others.

In 2011 Wooten formed his own record label, VIX Records (www.vixrecords.com), and released A Show of Hands-15, a re-mastered version of his debut recording. In 2012 Wooten simultaneously released two records: Words and Tones, featuring female vocalist, and the instrumental album Sword and Stone. With the continued success of his book The Music Lesson (www.themusiclesson.com) and his camps (www.vixcamps.com), Victor Wooten doesn&#39;t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.]]></artistBio2>

Since then things haven&#39;t exactly slowed down for Wes lately, as he was chosen by metal giants Korn as their touring guitar player, replacing Brian &#39;Head&#39; Welch on stage.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Wesley got into playing guitar when he heard Van Halen at the age of 15. &quot;I wanted to know how to make all those crazy sounds, and hammer-ons sounded so amazing -I just had to play. Iron Maiden was next with the dual harmonies calling to me. I played for eight hours a day, and because I was always moving as a kid the guitar was my best friend&quot;.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Bassist and singer-songwriter Yolanda Charles has worked with Urban Species, Raw Stylus, DC Lee, Paul Weller, Eric Clapton, BB King, Roger Daltry, Van Morrison and even Michael Jackson.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Yolanda Charles had a notable start to her career in the music business playing for Jimmy Sommerville and within bands Raw Stylus and Urban Species. She began playing at 15 and played soul, funk &amp; reggae in those early bands. Becoming a session player occurred through invitations to work with various artists after being seen live and over the years, it led to working for Paul Weller, Marcella Detroit, Howard New, Pops Mohammed, Alison Moyet, Desert Eagle Discs, Gabrielle and Robbie Williams.

Yolanda has been writing songs for almost as long as she has played bass. With writing more as a hobby at the beginning, she found herself working as a session bassist for most of her career. Up until 2002, all of her song-writing efforts remained on demo tapes, until she was persuaded by her partner Miles Bould to go into the recording studio. Her first song was &#39;Fantasy&#39; performed by Katie Kissoon (from Mac &amp; Katie), who Yolanda was working with at the time on the Robbie Williams gig. Yolanda describes recording her own songs as &#39;the most rewarding experience musically I&#39;d ever had&#39;. This led to an album released under the project name &#39;Mamayo&#39; with Carleen Anderson, Shaun Escoffery, Vanessa Freeman and Mandy Lecointe performing on vocals. Completed in 2003, this album entitled &#39;The Game&#39; saw Yolanda finally exploring the creativity all the demos had evidenced. Where her talents as a bass player were utilized by working with great artists, being in the studio offered the chance to be autonomous and the time to explore her creativity without commercial pressures. 

She says, &#39;I guess you could call it an indulgence in some ways, making a record without a fuller picture of how to sell it or market it, but the rewards this record has brought me, and still continues to bring, make it so worth it. I set out to make the best record I could at the time and although I could only work on it in the breaks off the road whilst touring with Robbie, all the hard work and sheer determination to finish it put me on the path upon which I now travel, in many ways a far more rewarding one.&#39;

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Yuji Adachi, best known as the guitarist &#39;YOU&#39; from the Japanese rock band Dead End, started playing guitar when he was in his teens. He quickly gained a reputation among various guitarists and joined Dead End, one of the hiking heavy melodic rock bands, in 1986.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Although the band was separated in 1990, and despite the fact that they didn&#39;t release that many albums, there are a lot of major Japanese artists today who profess their influence from Dead End&#39;s early adaptation of gothic and new wave tastes to heavy metal. Dead End was re-united in 2009 in conjunction with a 20-year anniversary project, and they released their comeback album &#39;METAMORPHOSIS&#39;. They came up with their latest album &#39;Dream Demon Analyzer&#39; in March 2012 and toured all around Japan after that.

Besides wielding the guitar in Dead End, Yuji has also released a total of two solo albums; &#39;Psychial Island&#39; released in September 1990, and &#39;You&#39;s Alien&#39; released in August 2005. His r&#233;sum&#233; holds a never ending list of collaborations with legendary artists such as Japanese singer-songwriter Ryuichi Kawamura from the rock band Luna Sea and Japanese pop singer Nami Tamaki. As if this wasn&#39;t enough, this equilibristic instrumental engineer also finds time to teach music lessons and run his very own guitar school.

When rocking on tour or recording in the studio, Yuji seeks inspiration in the wide range of cool effects TC has to offer. Our products provide him with the exact tools he needs to obtain his killer sound. We sat down to create a whole bunch of very unique TonePrints for the Corona Chorus, the Flashback Delay, The Dreamscape and the Vortex Flanger - some of Yuji&#39;s all time favorite guitar sounds.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Zoltan Bathory is the founder, guitarist and a major songwriter for the award winning LA metal band, Five Finger Death Punch. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Their debut album, The Way of the Fist, was released in July 2007 and has sold over 420,000 copies. Their second album, entitled War Is the Answer, was released in September 2009. The record sold over 44,000 copies on its first week of release and debuted #7 on the Billboard 200. All three singles off of the WITA cycle became top 10 hits, and the record sold over 300,000 copies in just 8 months. Further, Zoltan won the &quot;Best Shredder&quot; award at the 2010 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards. This award was the third Golden God trophy the band collected having already won the 2009 Best New Artist and 2010 Breakthrough Artist awards. With 6 top 10 singles under his belt, Zoltan is rapidly becoming one of the most successful songwriter/producers of modern day heavy metal.

When asked about his G-System Zoltan said… 

&#39;I started out with the original TC Electronic G-Major, but I then found out that the TC Electronic G-System can switch the channels on my head (Relay Switching). Now, I&#39;m using all of the G-system effects. I loved the effects on the G-Major already, and it&#39;s the same thing, but with all the extra features and the floor board. I said that if I was going to switch to this system, I would need something bulletproof and TC showed me that this was actually tank-proof!* My lead singer usually runs across my pedal board, so I figured if it could handle a tank it could probably handle Ivan too! He jumps on it nightly and throws water on it and so far, so good. It holds up nicely.

Besides the sound quality of the effects, a it&#39;s a huge plus that I don&#39;t have any gear in my rack anymore. I used to have all kinds of switchers and other stuff. Basically, right now I have this unit and it switches all my amps and it does everything that I need!&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Whether you have heard of Maor Appelbaum or not, you&#39;ve most definitely heard his work. His client list, while eclectic, is nothing short of amazing and among them you&#39;ll find everything ranging from alternative rock - metal pioneers Faith No More, progressive rock legends YES, metal mastodons Sepultura, Wagnerian rocker Meat Loaf and blues legend Walter Trout, to shred-legend Yngwie Malmsteen and all the way to actor, and master of the spoken word, William Shatner. When you find such different artists on the same list, it&#39;s time to sit up and take notice!

Maor Appelbaum was born in Israel and lived there for most of his life. He now works out of Los Angeles in his own mastering studio, Maor Appelbaum Mastering, where he works his masterful mastering magic.

A background as a club DJ and music journalist, has given Appelbaum a deep understanding of how the listeners perceive the music, and as a musician he understands the artistic process behind music production. All of this translates into his mastering work where he sees himself as a liaison between the production and the listeners.

His deep understanding of the artistic and technical aspects of music, as well as a finely tuned sense of the audience allows him to convey the intentions and the message of the artists to the music hitting the listeners.

Maor likes to experiment with his work, making sure to get just the right combination of gear and settings for each song to shine: &#39;First of all I listen to the music,&#39; he says, and while that sounds simple, it is key to making sure the finished product respects the music and the artist even while changing the sound for maximum impact.

Appelbaum&#39;s way to achieving maximum impact varies from track to track and sometimes requires a very light touch. The mark of a master is knowing when to back off, and let the mix stand on its own. If the mix is nearly perfect, it might take some experimenting before Appelbaum is absolutely sure it&#39;s as good as it&#39;s going to be - even if he sometimes ends up changing very little. &#39;Every recording has a sweet spot. If you push it beyond that, you end up making it worse,&#39; he says.
 

Appelbaum uses three TC System 6000&#39;s in his setup. Maor has a lot of different gear, both digital and analog, so having something as versatile as the System 6000 is essential. &#39;It&#39;s like reading an encyclopaedia. Every day you find something new to do with it. I really like it. The quality is great and the user interface is easy to use.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As one of the two founding members of the alternative rock outfit Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Peter Hayes lives and breathes music, and to him the guitar acts as a natural extension of himself, simply taking over where words aren&#39;t enough. TC Electronic gear has been an essential part of Peter&#39;s rig for years now, and it helps him achieve the intense multilayered sonic universe that&#39;s at the core of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club&#39;s massive sound.

When Peter was 14 or 15 years old, he got in trouble and was grounded for over a year. He took his mother&#39;s guitar and started playing, simply because he had nothing else to do. Peter&#39;s mother taught him some flamingo and fingerpicking songs on her nylon guitar, which still influences his unique style to this day. Shortly after he started playing guitar he discovered Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd, and from that moment on Peter knew that his future belonged to rock n roll. In the process of copying the style of Hendrix, he used a lot of alternate tunings in order to sound as both lead and rhythm guitar, but he quickly discovered the impossibility in copying Hendrix and started focusing on creating his own personal style around the plethora of open tunings he discovered.

Peter met his future bandmate Robert Levon Been in high school, and they quickly started jammin&#39; together. But out of the blue Peter got a try-out with The Brian Jonestown Massacre, who needed a guitar player at that time. Peter got the gig and toured with them for a year, but he thinks his van was the main reason for the gig, since the band needed a van to get to South by Southwest (SXSW). 

After being on tour with The Brian Jonestown Massacre for a year, Peter got back to playing with Robert which in no time led to the birth of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, a reference to Marlon Brando&#39;s motorcycle gang in &#39;The Wild One&#39; (1953). And as they say… from there the rest is history. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club has recorded 7 studio albums and when their current tour is over, they&#39;re heading back to the studio to record the next album. This band is unstoppable!]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Tim Lefebvre possesses the willingness and ability to speak the language of those around him, which has led him to be on speed dial for countless artists. He produces, composes, remixes and of course plays a killer bass. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Lefebvre majored in both political science and economics before exploring the stage life on a cruise for the first time. When he returned his motivation for more was sky high. Lefebvre went straight for New York&#39;s underground live electronica and jazz scene. With full exposure to the city&#39;s most progressive players nothing held him back. Word spread quickly that a new impressive bassist was in town and Lefebvre&#39;s opportunities grew full speed. 

His career skyrocketed when he subbed in Saturday Night Live&#39;s house band. It did not take him long to catch the eye of television and film executives opening new doors for him. He got to play and write for shows such as &#39;The Sopranos&#39;, &#39;30 Rock&#39;, &#39;the Late Night Show With David Letterman&#39; and &#39;The Apprentice&#39;.  
Soon after Hollywood was all over him. Lefebvre performed on a number of movie soundtracks including &#39;Oceans 12&#39;, &#39;The Departed&#39; and &#39;Analyze That&#39;. He composed music for &#39;Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle&#39; and &#39;Please Give&#39; as well as commercials for Microsoft and Chevrolet. 
Lefebvre&#39;s major establishment came after his Domestic and European tour with saxophonist Donny McCaslin, which rooted his status as one of the industry&#39;s most sought-after rhythm partners. 

Lefebvre&#39;s good spirits, open mind and willingness to play with anyone and everyone has fast-forwarded his development making it possible for him t play with musical geniuses such as guitarist Wayne Krantz and neo-classical jazz pianist Uri Caine. 
He is a musical multi-linguist is equally perfect in rock, jazz, fusion, electronica, R&amp;B and any other genre he gets his hands on. 

He has a big passion for bass, effects, gear and recording which has been a key component of his success. His ability to take sounds from various genres and implement these into other musical situations is amazing. He blends the elements so smooth, creating and entirely new sound. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Nathaniel Kearney Jr. is the living proof that dedication, strong work ethics and perfecting your sound will take you places. In the case of Nathanial it has led him to play with some of the biggest names within the world of Soul and RnB. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[It&#39;s hard to believe that Nathaniel wasn&#39;t born with a bass in his hand once you hear him play, but as a matter of fact the bass wasn&#39;t his first choice when it came to picking a place to start within the world of music.
At a young age Nathaniel developed a love for drums after spending countless hours listening to Gospel music like The Mighty Clouds of Joy, The Pilgrim Jubilees and The Williams Brothers, and he immediately started playing the drums for his local church and different quartet groups in his area. Later on he started to learn the bass to get a better grasp of how great rhythm sections work. Little did he know that this was to become one of his best career choices ever!

After he picked up the bass he began listening to a more eclectic mix of music where the likes of Bonnie Raitt, Luther Vandross, Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers, The Temptations, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, Stevie Wonder, &amp; Aerosmith quickly became favorites of his. All of these different genres had a very profound influence on Nathaniel&#39;s development as a bass player, and after deciding to pursue a career in music it is in fact his amazing versatility that has stood out as one of his biggest forces, next to his exceptional bass tone of course.

In 2005 he was called up to play for Kurt Carr &amp; The Kurt Carr Singers, which saw him evolve immensely as a live musician. After a great run with Kurt Carr, Nathaniel decided to move to Los Angeles in 2009, which later proved to be the second best decision in his life after picking up the bass. This move would later see him play on stage with the likes of Babyface, Chuck Loeb, Toni Braxton, Avant, Taio Cruz and Smooth Jazz superstar Dave Koz, but also see him perform on huge TV shows like Ellen (NBC), The Monique Show (BET), and Lopez Tonight (TBS).

Currently, Nate is still holding down the low-end fort for Grammy Nominee Dave Koz, while also working hard on the follow-up to his solo debut &#39;Back To Bassics&#39; from 2012.

When asked how he feels about his TC Electronic gear, Nathaniel is only full of enthusiasm and praise.  &#39;I&#39;ve waited a long time for bass equipment that offers so much for REALISTIC situations.  Every feature offered is something ALL bass players can and will use.  Whether I&#39;m playing Rock, R&amp;B, Pop or Smooth Jazz…using electric bass, bass synth, or my ukulele…my TC gear does one thing, and one thing only…DELIVER.  ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[When you want something, you go for it! And in the case of Teja Veal this expression couldn&#39;t be more fitting. 

After being denied the spot as bass player in her middle school orchestra program, simply because her teacher didn&#39;t think that girls should play bass, she started an extensive campaign together with her mother to convince the school and teacher that Teja belonged on bass. In the end the teacher cracked, and accepted to give Teja the spot as bass player under the condition that she had to learn the instrument entirely by herself. Teja accepted the challenge, and as they say… the rest is history!

She started gigging at the age of 16, and so far her unique style, which combines her big-band jazz schooling with her love of old-school soul, has seen her land tours with notable acts such as Frank McComb, Musiq Soulchild and Grammy Award Nominee Janelle Mon&#225;e.

After years of focusing purely on ensemble-bass and acting as a supporting member, she is now finally ready to take on a solo-career as well and bring her amazing bass playing to the front where it belongs!]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Jordan Rudess&#39; virtuoso keyboard skills that combine blazing fast runs with an amazing ear for catchy melodies and all-encompassing soundscapes have seen him transcend the typical keyboard player&#39;s ensemble role, and moved him to the front as one of our times best musicians.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Jordan&#39;s undeniable talent was already discovered during 2nd grade, and he was immediately given professional training to hone it. At the age of 9, Jordan entered the Juillard School of Music where he began studying classical piano, but after being introduced to progressive rock, through acts such as Pink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson and Genesis, and the vast sonic potential of modern synthesizers in his late teens there was no turning back, and Jordan immediately ditched the classical piano for keyboards, synths and the amazing world of prog.rock.

After being voted &#39;Best New Talent&#39; by Keyboard Magazine in 1994, the world of prog.rock started to notice Jordan, and after a quick stint with the legendary Dixie Dregs and progressive super group Liquid Tension Experiment, Jordan joined Dream Theater in 1999, and hasn&#39;t looked back since! After the addition of Jordan to the line-up, Dream Theater recorded and released their masterpiece Metropolis Pt.2: Scenes From a Memory, and have continued to go from strength to strength since then. So far Dream Theater has released eight stellar albums with Rudess behind the keys.

In 2011 Rudess was voted the best keyboardist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar.

In short, Jordan isn&#39;t just a musician. He&#39;s a magician!

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Phil Demmel was all set to quit the music business, when he agreed to go on one last tour with friend and former band-mate Robb Flynn&#39;s band Machine Head. The chemistry turned out to be undeniable, and the rest, as they say, is history.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[That was in 2002, and Demmel has been an integral part of Machine Head ever since. He draws his influences from a wide range of bands across many genres of metal and beyond. Thrash metal and groove metal may be the most obvious, but many of the greats from the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s have influenced the sound as well. Demmel cites Angus Young of AC/DC as one of his earliest influences, and one of the primary reasons for picking up his first guitar.
&#160;
While Machine Head played for many years without Demmel, he turned out to be a perfect fit with the aggressive and melodic music of the band.
&#160;
From Dublin, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Demmel grew up. In the 80&#39;ies when the Thrash movement was blossoming in the area, and bands like Metallica were blazing a trail, for young dreamers with long hair and pointy guitars.
&#39;They paved the way and gave us all hope that it was possible,&#39; Demmel has said of Metallica&#39;s influence.
&#160;
Drawn to the aggressiveness and energetic nature of the style, he joined thrash band Vio-Lence right out of high school. They put out a few records and toured enough to assure the young Demmel, that he would spend his life as a musician.
Robb Flynn, left Vio-Lence to start Machine Head in 1991, which very quickly became one of Demmel&#39;s favorite bands, though it would be more than ten years before chance brought them together again, when Demmel joined Machine Head.
&#160;
By that point Demmel&#39;s own music career had slowed down somewhat, and going on tour with Machine Head was supposed to be a one time thing. A sort of last hurrah.
&#39;It would bring closure to my music career. But the chemistry was just magic.&#39;

Demmel has released four albums with Machine Head since joining in 2002, filling the time between releases with an almost inhuman tour schedule.
On their latest album, Bloodstone and Diamonds the TC Electronic Flashback Delay was instrumental in achieving the aggressive sound and the screaming lead lines, that bring metal heads across the world to Machine Head&#39;s shows.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Ira Coleman&#39;s impressively lyrical bass playing has helped shape the groove for many notable musicians throughout the years, but if you&#39;ve only heard of him recently, chances are that you know him from his work with Sting.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Ira first met Sting when he was recording his album &#39;If on a Winter&#39;s Night…&#39; back in 2009. Sting&#39;s producer had heard Ira&#39;s work and wanted him to come in for a session with Sting to lay down some bass for a song on the album.
But Sting was so impressed by what he heard that Ira ended up playing on eight tracks on that album, and has toured and played live with Sting ever since.

 
His first love though, was jazz, and he has played with many of the most respected and well-known artists in the genre. Cab Calloway, Herbie Hancock and The Duke Ellington Orchestra, to name just a few.

Ira is a truly international musician. Born in Stockholm Sweden, to American and Swedish jazz-loving parents and raised in France and then Germany. When he was 24 he got accepted to the Hochschule f&#252;r Musik, K&#246;ln in Cologne, Germany. He attended for two years until he got accepted at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Mass. Berklee is perhaps the world&#39;s most prominent institute for studying jazz music. After graduating in 1985 he moved to New York, where he still lives.

Ira Coleman didn&#39;t start playing the bass, or any instrument, until he was in his twenties. His parent&#39;s love of jazz had formed much of his musical style and preferences at an early age, but actually playing didn&#39;t come until much later, where Ira finally found the instrument that made it all click for him.
 
&#39;It&#39;s really important to find the instrument that fits your character. I like to be a team player,  I like being part of a rhythm section.&#39; Ira says of why he eventually chose to pick up the bass. &#39;It&#39;s not for everybody. The primary role of the bass is to support, and I love doing that.&#39;
 
Ira&#39;s sound, just like himself, is nice and mellow. Smooth tones to ease you along and guide you through the music. Ira mainly plays the upright bass, but in playing with Sting he has found a love for the electric bass as well.
&#39;On the upright, the only effect I might use is a TC Electronic Reverb. It makes the sound a little more lyrical.&#39;

Ira has played on Sting&#39;s three latest albums, as well as nearly a hundred albums with other artists, and now with the addition of the BH800 to his sonic arsenal there&#39;s no doubt that Ira&#39;s expressive playing is sure to find its way to at least a hundred albums more.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[With one leg in the brit-rock/indie camp as musical director and co-writer for Morrissey since 1991, and with the other well-rooted in the rockabilly scene through his legendary work with The Polecats, there&#39;s only one word that truly describes Boz Boorer and that is versatility!]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Boorer was born in 1962 in Edgware in North London, where he grew up, and where The Polecats were founded in 1977, when Boz was 15 years old. After playing with The Polecats for 14 years he started playing with Morrissey, as well as functioning as musical director and co-writer on many of Morrissey&#39;s songs.

Working with Morrissey is Boorer&#39;s main gig, so his work with the Polecats and his solo career has to take a back seat most of the time. Yet, he has still managed to put out four albums with the Polecats, four solo albums, and numerous collaborations with other artists since he started working with Morrissey almost 25 years ago. So to call Boz a well-rounded musician must be seen as the understatement of the year!
Even though fans of The Polecats may see Boorer as mainly a rockabilly guitarist, and probably wouldn&#39;t have expected the work with Morrissey to be as successful as it has been, Boz himself have seen his relationship with Morrissey as a match made in music heaven from day one:
&#39;One thing I enjoy with Morrissey is that there are no real musical boundaries. There are no laws to how it&#39;s supposed to be,&#39; Boorer says, explaining why he&#39;s never gotten bored working with the same man for so long. 
 
Boorer&#39;s style can be hard to describe, because it varies so much depending on the song and who he&#39;s playing with, but one common thread that weaves through everything is the confidence and competence of a true professional with nearly 4 decades at the top of his game.
Not satisfied with being a versatile guitarist, Boorer also plays the clarinet, saxophone, bass, drums, and piano, and he produces for several up-and-coming indie bands in his studio in Portugal - you know, for variety.

Recently Boz integrated the Flashback Delay into his rig due to its… yeah, you guessed it… extreme versatility, letting him effortlessly adapt from playing with Morrissey to the crisp sound of the Polecats and the cornucopia of sounds and styles that make up his solo work.

Boorer&#39;s latest solo album, Some Of The Parts, came out in 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, being hailed as one of the most varied albums in recent years.
Boz Boorer has released 11 albums with The Polecats, eight albums with Morrissey and four solo albums. The first single from his fifth solo album is out now and the album is due out in 2015.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Ethan Farmer AKA EBassMan is one of the most confident bass players you&#39;re ever likely to meet. His talent and musicality speak for themselves, but it&#39;s his charisma and personality that makes this cat so special. While he cut his teeth on gospel, this guy oozes funk from every single pore!]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[When you hear Ethan Farmer play you probably won&#39;t be thinking about gospel, even though his first 10 years in the music business was in the family gospel quartet - The Amazing Farmer Singers. 
Since then he&#39;s branched out, and like a chameleon he adapts to any style of music while still maintaining his own unique sound. A sexy, funky sound that can be adapted to any style of playing and accompany any artist.
This ability has led to working with some of the biggest stars in the business, like Lionel Richie, Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet Boys and many more.

Ethan Farmer grew up in Chicago and a lot of his early experience came in playing with the family gospel group in churches around Chicago. When he was 16 he had played shows all over the United States with his family quartet. It was also around this time, he started to think about other genres. In 1998 he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music. He was encouraged to see many of his idols playing the clubs there. Going as often as possible, grabbing any opportunity to jam with the veterans is what ultimately got him his break. He has played with hundreds of artists since then - but when he can, he still plays the small local clubs. Both to hone his craft and to help young aspiring artists with advice or mentorship.

Currently he plays a lot with his own project with Chip Shearin, The Avengers. If you like bass players going all out, you should probably give that a listen.
&#39;Bass in your face all over the place,&#39; is how Farmer describes the project.
Ethan Farmer&#39;s TC rig is made up of BH800 bass amp and a couple of RS210 cabinets.
&#39;I only play stuff that I love. I love the sound, I love the tone, I love what they do for my playing.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

Guitar					</artistSegment>
					<artistBio><![CDATA[Kirk Fletcher is what you might call &#39;The Real Deal&#39;. A younger blues guitarist that can hang with the greatest blues guitarists in history. In fact he has played with several legendary blues guitarists and is fast on his way to becoming one himself.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Kirk Fletcher started playing the guitar when he was 8, inspired by his older brother Walter, who he still lists as his single biggest inspiration. For years, until Kirk was in his early twenties, they played several times a week in their fathers church. In high school he played with a lot of gospel and R&amp;B groups. But underneath it all blues was always his true love.

That love, and Kirk&#39;s unquestioned talent and work ethic has led him to be hailed by some as the world&#39;s best current blues guitarist. Besides being a sought-after sideman guitarist, Fletcher spent many years as part of several bands, perhaps most notably the legendary blues rock band The Fabulous Thunderbirds between 2005-2008.
Since leaving the Thunderbirds he has released a very well received solo album with his own band. The album, My Turn, marks a couple of interesting changes for Fletcher. He started writing a lot of the songs, as well as singing them himself. He never really sang before, so he thought he should get a singer. He had a hard time finding a singer he liked but was reluctant to take on that role himself. 
&#39;A lot of my friends were saying, Man, just try it. Just sing one song. And so I just tried it. Now I&#39;ve really started to enjoy learning to sing. It&#39;s almost becoming my main thing.&#39;

For fans of Fletchers guitar playing that might sound a little scary, but he assures us, that he&#39;s still learning something new every time he picks up the guitar. He continues to pick it up every day, so the best from Kirk Fletcher should still be ahead of us.

Fletcher doesn&#39;t use many effects in his setup, preferring the sound of a good clean amp cranked up to high volume, most of the time. Liking a good clean, bright tone, with just enough gain to make the note speak, as he says. However, he does profess his love for an awesome reverb, like the Hall of Fame Reverb from TC.
&#39;Reverb is probably my biggest crutch, because it just feels good to have reverb. I guess I&#39;m kind of a reverb junkie&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Brian Hardgroove is probably best known as the bass player for legendary hip-hop group Public Enemy. He has also toured with Bootsy Collins and T.M. Stevens in a three bass player tour, making for a truly epic bass line.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a child Brian wanted to be a police officer. A dream that lasted until he was 14. That&#39;s when he won tickets to see Earth, Wind and Fire in a radio contest, and when he knew he wanted to play music for a living. He never looked back.
&#39;I had what you call an epiphany,&#39; he says.
With an origin story like that, it might be obvious, that Earth, Wind and Fire was a huge influence on Brian&#39;s musical endeavours early on.

While he is most known for playing with Public Enemy he has a lot of other things going. He is the artist in residence at Santa Fe University of Art and Design, where he has had a hand in starting a program called Artists for Positive Social Change. He has produced records with a couple of the biggest punk acts in China, feeling a kinship with their critical approach to authority.
He is also the founder of From a Whisper to a Dream, a project that aims to connect young artists trying to make a living through music to equipment manufacturers, trying to set up mutually beneficial endorsement deals.

Brian has been using a BG250-115 bass combo for smaller shows for a while now, and he really digs the feature set, the quality and the outstanding sound. He notes, that a relatively small thing like the built-in tuner actually works extremely well.
&#39;A couple of amp companies are putting tuners on amps now, but this one is very fast and responds very accurately, which is NOT the case on most of the ones I&#39;ve seen.&#39;
Features are one thing, but obviously, what really matters is how it sounds. And of course the TC rig hasn&#39;t let him down there either:
&#39;I use it in small intimate environments where getting good sound is tough, and it&#39;s been great. I love it.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

Public Enemy&#39;s bass player, Brian Hardgroove, knows what he likes on stage: Tons of thundering bass that kicks some serious xxx! To get that kind of power and tone, he uses three RS212 cabinets and a RH450 amp. In other words, Hardgroove joined the bass amp 2.0 revolution, and as he puts it: I am never going back!]]></youtubeDescription>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Paul Frazier started playing piano when he was five years old. He branched out to the trombone and the drums while still in school, before finally settling on the bass, which has been his constant companion since he picked up the first one when he was around 10 years old.

The list of people that Paul has played with is frankly breathtaking: He&#39;s worked with Sharon Corr (The Corrs), Arrested Development, Michael Tolcher, Lucy Woodward, Idina Menzel of Frozen fame, Grace Weber, Shawn Colvin, St. Vincent, Chaka Khan, Joss Stone, Cab and Chris Calloway among many others. He has done live shows and tours with such legends as Sara McLachlan, Bonnie Raitt, Natalie Merchant on the Lilith Fair with Imani Coppola, The Weather Girls, Renee Fleming, Arcade Fire, Norah Jones, Crosby, Stills and Nash and more. As that rather long list of musicians should make clear, Paul Frazier brings his A game to all types of music.

Despite his many accomplishments he is probably most known for his work with David Byrne of the Talking Heads. Who he has worked with for years. The collaboration has worked out well. Frazier appreciates Byrne&#39;s willingness to try new things: &#39;David Byrne is someone who I admire very much and there is a lot that we have in common. He&#39;s just constantly reinventing himself, not because he wants to be trendy. He&#39;s just interested in constantly learning and expanding.&#39;

The versatility of Paul&#39;s TC rig allows him to move between music genres and playing styles with absolute certainty, knowing everything will come through with the power and clarity he needs.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Robert Levon Been is one of the founding members of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. He is best known as a bassist and singer, and his crushing tone and distinct voice acts as the cornerstone of BRMC&#39;s unique sound.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Been is from Santa Cruz, California and was born in 1978. He formed Black Rebel Motorcycle Club with guitarist Peter Hayes, after they met in High School in San Francisco.
In the beginning, many thought the band was from England, probably owing to the influence of bands like The Verve and perhaps the fact, that their first drummer Nick Jago was in fact from Devon, England.

Been favours a heavily distorted sound and an aggressive playing style. He uses a pick to play the bass most of the time. His booming heavily overdriven tone is a signature of both Been himself and BRMC.
His very aggressive playing style is somewhat at odds with his quiet demeanour when speaking, so if you didn&#39;t know what to expect, you might be surprised at the power that hits you when the speakers start making waves. Despite the heavy distortion, and the aggressive style, Been&#39;s bass lines are often very melodic.

When his father Michael Been, who had been the frontman for rock band The Call, live sound engineer, and something of a mentor for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, suffered a fatal heart attack while on tour with BRMC in Belgium, it was a huge blow, not only to Been, but to the entire band.
In 2013, Robert appeared as bassist and lead singer as his fathers old band The Call reunited for two concerts in 2013.

His appearance as frontman of reunited The Call showed a somewhat softer side of Robert Been. It also challenged him, both vocally, because The Call&#39;s songs typically have a bigger range than BRMC&#39;s and on the bass, because it&#39;s a different style than Robert Been had been used to playing. A less aggressive, cleaner sound.

The newest album from BRMC Specter at the Feast is probably the most personal, and certainly the most emotionally raw record from the band, as they worked through the legacy of the late Michael Been. The single &#39;Let the Day Begin&#39; is a cover of one of Michael Been&#39;s songs with The Call.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Bryan is a member of Supergroup The Aristocrats with Guthrie Govan and Marco Minnemann. He also plays in what might be called The Monkees of death metal, Dethklok from the animated Adult Swim show Metalocalypse.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[The thing about Bryan Beller, is that he can play pretty much anything in any style, so it&#39;s hard to pin down a specific style, that you might call &#39;his&#39;. With Dethklok he plays hard death metal with aggressive finger moves. In prog rock supergroup The Aristocrats his playing is certainly still very decisive, but perhaps not quite as aggressive or hardly driven. His solo work is more along the lines of jazz/rock.
Besides his work as a solo artist and with his various bands, he has worked as a sideman for such luminaries as Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and many others.

If you like music where no instrument is a second class citizen, then The Aristocrats may be for you. Beller, Govan and Minnemann all write songs, and seem to challenge the other band members, to bring out the very best in each other. And when you&#39;re playing with legendary virtuosos like Guthrie Govan and Marco Minnemann, your best has to be good.

It&#39;s not exactly unusual to find great versatility in a musician at this level, but for someone to move effortlessly between jazz fusion and death metal, and do both extremely competently and with authority is hardly typical. And he mostly plays all of it on the same bass. A Mike Lull Custom 5-string. He does switch it up occasionally with a four-string instead of his usual five.
Bryan Beller has been using the Flashback Delay and Hall Of Fame Reverb, and he is very impressed by their performance and features.

&quot;Every time I engage them, I&#39;m inspired to play something beyond what I&#39;d originally imagined. And the tonal flexibility is unmatched - first with the stock pedal settings, and then even more with the Toneprint capability.&quot; 

Active since around &#39;94, Beller&#39;s first solo album didn&#39;t come out until 2003. It was incredibly well received in bass circles. He has since released another studio album and a live album. With the Aristocrats he has relesed two studio albums and a live album.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Whether he&#39;s writing songs for others, working on production or playing the bass himself Andr&#233; &#39;Dr&#233;&#39; Bowman is going to make the bass line something special.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Andr&#233; Bowman amazing bass chops has led him to play with some of the biggest stars in the business. Usher, Mary J. Blige, Ashlee Simpson, and The Black Eyed Peas to name just a few.

In fact, it&#39;s hard to stop listing the crazy list of legends Dr&#233; has worked with. like Jay-Z, Cee-Lo Green, Backstreet Boys, Stevie Wonder, John Legend, Alicia Keys, Busta Rhymes, Doug E. Fresh, Slick Rick, and Biz Markie - to name just a few more…

Bowman has played since he was seven. Starting with the cello, he later moved to the upright bass. It was only later that he heard someone at school playing the electric, that he lost his heart to the arcane art of the electric bass. Dr&#233; attended the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston. He lists some of his influences as Jaco Pastorius, Marcus Miller, Nathan East and Bootsy Collins.

Dr&#233; likes to make the bass line mean something. To make it something people will remember. It has to support the song of course, but he also likes to make it special enough that it&#39;ll make people move and take note.

Dr&#233; currently works as a bassist and tour playback engineer for R&amp;B superstar Usher. He also plays bass for will.i.am and the Backstreet Boys.
In addition to the performance aspect of his career, Dr&#233; writes and produces as well.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[David Hewitt&#39;s Company, Hewitt Remote Services, is among the first choices for anyone who needs a high end Remote Recording Truck and crew. Hewitt has been recording live Shows since the early 1970s, working with some of the biggest stars and live events in the industry.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Hewitt has worked with everyone from Aretha to Zappa and has recorded such Jazz Stars as Miles Davis and Classic events such as the Metropolitan Opera. 

&#39;When you have Clients like these, you better bring the best available gear and TC is at the top of that list. When you apply effects like reverb to live instruments, you really start to hear the difference between these devices. The TC is just so clean and realistic.&#39;

For fifteen years Hewitt has worked with the Academy Awards and Tom Vicari to provide the live Orchestra Mix. This of course has to match up with the pre-recorded tracks Tom has recorded at Capitol Studios for play ons, bumpers, etc. In both locations they use TC System 6000 to blend seamlessly together.

While much of the work you do in a Remote Truck is similar to Studio work, it&#39;s the differences that have kept David Hewitt on the road for more than 40 years. You have to be able plan ahead and think on your feet. Anything that can go wrong, eventually will. As the saying goes, &#39;The Show is that little inconvenience between the Load-in and the Load-out&#39;. To him the Studio is focused on the individual elements of Music, while the Remote Truck deals with live Music in real time.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Steve has used the System 6000 for many years. Almost since it came out in 1999. In fact most of the engineers at Capitol have used it since then.

&#39;Our friend Casey Young came in and said: &#39;I&#39;ve got this great new reverb box. You gotta hear it.&#39;
We did what we always do when someone says they have something new. We said &quot;Yeah, yeah, bring it down, we&#39;ll see.&quot;

They didn&#39;t expect a revolution—you rarely do—but any skepticism vanished as soon as they heard the kind of sounds the System 6000 could make.
&#39;It&#39;s been in our arsenal ever since. The great thing about the 6000 is, that it doesn&#39;t sound like reverb. It just sounds natural. Not processed.&#39;

Steve has worked with a remarkable range of artists within many genres of music. He is equally at home working with jazz, rock &#39;n&#39; roll, hip-hop and R&amp;B, from large orchestras to single artist recordings. With such a range of sounds there are always many decisions about what mics and equipment to use. However, the System 6000 is flexible enough to adapt to pretty much anything.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As anyone who works with such a range of different styles and sounds, Smith needs his equipment to be able to handle whatever he throws at it.

&#39;The system 6000 is an integral part of my work. You can do anything you want with it. It&#39;s a reverb device, with some of the finest world-class reverbs around in any format. It&#39;s a mastering tool, it&#39;s a compressor, it&#39;s a digital EQ, a multi-band limiter,&#39; he says.

The System 6000 can do so much, that it&#39;s sometimes hard to pin down how it might fit into your particular workflow. That&#39;s why we like to ask studio pros, which feature is the most important for them. However, often it is the very fact that System 6000 does so much that ends up making it so indispensable.

&#39;The one feature that I like about it, is that I can do anything I want with it. There is no one feature, except that I don&#39;t have to read a manual to figure it out. The tools are there to do whatever you want. It&#39;s up to you how you use them.&#39;

Bill Smith is lucky enough to have worked with System 6000 for many years. In fact he has used the system since it first came out.
&#39;When it came out, like anything that high end, for the type of work I do, it&#39;s something you&#39;re going to take a look at. I&#39;ve used the System 6000 since I first tried it in 1999, it was one of the first ones to come out of the factory.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Doell is a mastering engineer at Universal Mastering Studios. But his background is quite diverse. He was a recording engineer and mixer at Capitol Records, and he did scoring for Sony Pictures. He has mastered well over 100 albums and worked as a recording engineer and mixer on even more.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a mastering engineer, Pete Doell is often faced with the challenge of making the client&#39;s record appear loud, primarily to compete with other music on the radio, and to achieve a sound that is both musical and pleasant, despite the loudness war.

&#39;The TC System 6000 has a lot of tools that are so musical, that it&#39;s hard to imagine life without them, once you&#39;re used to them. It has a brickwall limiter that is pretty damn transparent. It is great for making loud records that still sound musical. And the multi-band compression lets me compress just the cymbals or guitars, without touching the rest, if I need to.&#39;

It&#39;s this precision control that keeps Doell coming back to the System 6000. And though he doesn&#39;t use the incredible reverbs in the 6000 often in mastering, it does come up sometimes.

&#39;Every once in a while you&#39;ll have a mix, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Spatially, your ears think it sort of sounds wrong. Sometimes I&#39;ll use a room algorithm from the TC, and add some reverb. Suddenly it can make much better sense to your ears, because you hear it in a space. It&#39;s one of the odd uses of the 6000&#39;s reverb stuff, that finds its way into mastering. I don&#39;t use it a lot, but it&#39;s great when I need it.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As an independent recording engineer, Tommy Vicari has worked with a very diverse clientele. He has produced for everything from Prince to Disney Theme Park music.

When recording something like the Oscars, there are many things to take into consideration. First off, there are many different types of music being recorded, and all have to sound good. On top of that, some things are prerecorded, while other things are recorded live.
Generally the singers are live, but sometimes a lot of the music will be prerecorded. To make that sound good it has to be almost indistinguishable what is live and what is pre-recorded. The reverb effects in the TC System 6000 are probably the most natural sounding in the business, which makes it a lot easier to get those sounds to match up.

&#39;I have to be able to handle classical music, film scores, Aerosmith or anything that I might need for the show. And sometimes it changes at a moments notice.&#39;

When we ask him to pinpoint the one most useful feature of the System 6000, he can&#39;t.
&#39;It&#39;s the versatility,&#39; he said. &#39;The fact that I can use it for whatever kind of music I&#39;m working with, any kind of room. It&#39;s a great unit, I use it every day.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Josh Smith is what you might call a blues prodigy. He has been playing since he was 3, and gigging steadily since 13 or 14.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[He grew up in a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and at 12 years old he was already playing in the established professional venues like the Musicians Exchange Caf&#233; in Fort Lauderdale. He quickly caught the ears of patrons and other musicians alike.
 
When Josh was 13, his talent also caught the attention of Don Cohen, owner of the Musicians Exchange Cafe, who offered to manage him and help develop his career.
 
Josh&#39;s young age may have helped Don Cohen open a few doors, When a lot of the blues greats passing through the club thought it might be fun to have the local young guy sit in on a couple of sessions. However, it quickly became apparent, that Josh Smith was more than a novelty. His chops and sheer talent were undeniable. That led him to becoming the lead guitarist in local blues band The Rhino Cats at the tender age of 13. The band became very popular in South Florida in the following years, and even won a Florida Jammy Award as best blues band.
While playing with The Rhino Cats, Smith also found time to publish his first two solo albums, when he was 14 and 15 years old.
 
After graduating High School, Josh went touring with his newly formed band, Josh Smith and the Frost. During the next few years, Josh Smith and The Frost completed several national tours, and recorded a couple of CD&#39;s.
 
In 2002, he relocated to Los Angeles with his wife. They still live there with their two children.
After moving to Los Angeles, Josh has transitioned somewhat. He still plays solo and still releases  solo records but he also works as a popular sideman guitarist. In that capacity, he has completed two national tours with American Idol winner Taylor Hicks, and since 2008 he has played with R&amp;B legend Raphael Saadiq.
 
Josh&#39;s playing is very articulate. He really wants you to hear the notes coming through. He favors precision over speed, which leads to a very clean sounding style, that has led some fans to call his playing &#39;perfect&#39;. Many note his incredible tone as one of the defining characteristics of his music.
When it comes to the playing you&#39;re on your own, but the tone — that we can help you with, with The Flashback Delay, and the Toneprint feature.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Stephen Carpenter lead guitarist in Deftones, underscores the groups melodic vocals with a heavily distorted guitar sound that is purely distilled metal.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Hey, we all like strings here. But Stephen Carpenter just can&#39;t get enough of them. For the last 5 years he has played an eight-string guitar.

Like most guitarists Carpenter started out on a regular six string, but influence from bands like Fear Factory and Meshuggah led him to take up a seven string guitar in the late 90s. From 2010 onwards he kicked it up a notch with an extra string.
&#39;Why would you play less guitar, when you can play more guitar?&#39; as he says.

As a true Californian, Carpenter grew up skateboarding. In fact, it was while recovering from a skateboarding accident he began to teach himself guitar at the age of 15. Bands such as Anthrax and Metallica formed his earliest influences. Although he has later stated that he now listens mostly to hip hop, he still lists Chaosphere by Meshuggah as his favourite album of all time.

Like his inspirations before him, Stef uses a lot of effects to achieve his sound. Among those effects are a range of products from TC. He has used the legendary 2290 Delay from TC for many years, and continues to do so. Lately he has really taken to the mini pedal series. The smaller the pedal, the more of them you can fit on your board after all.
He uses the Hall Of Fame Mini Reverb pedal, the Flashback Delay Mini, and the Corona Chorus Mini. All are toneprint enabled, which means that even with these small pedals the flexibility and precision control is unrivalled in the industry. And certainly unrivalled by anything else this compact.
He also uses the revolutionary Polytune 2 to keep everything effortlessly in tune.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[As a musician Peter Freeman has played with Seal and Alanis Morissette. As a producer and mixer, he works on everything from records to live performances, with a focus on film and TV.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[He has used TC products for many years starting with the legendary 2290 Delay. He actually still uses the 2290 which will always have a special place in his heart.
&#39;That&#39;s my favourite delay ever&#39;

More recently he has been introduced to the System 6000, drawn by its ability to create incredibly natural sound — specifically the surround reverbs.
&#39;Recently I mixed a film score for composer Anton Sanko for a film called Visions. The score had a strong orchestral component. The strings in particular had to have a very organic natural sounding texture. The richness in the surround reverbs give a real acoustic sounding realism. The 6000 was absolutely the key to that. It was just great. It was exactly what I needed,&#39; Freeman said.

Obviously, the power of System 6000 is not only in its actual power, but in how easily that power is harnessed. As Freeman puts it:

&#39;Aside from the obvious sound quality of it, it&#39; s really the layout of the design and the user interface that make System 6000 great. I learned it very quickly without having to open the manual. It was just very logically presented and didn&#39;t really require any effort to get it configured to do what I needed to do. The 6000 is a nice balance between great power in terms of what you can actually do at any given moment with a good simple UI you can get without too much head scratching.&#39;

As a musician Peter has played with a variety of big stars, like Seal, Alanis Morissette and John Cale from The Velvet Underground.
In a lot of his film work he plays several instruments for the score besides doing the mixing.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Chuck Jacobs has been a professional bass player for more than 40 years. He has played with a long list of superstars, like Dolly Parton, Ray Charles, and Lionel Richie. He has also been Kenny Rogers&#39; bassist since 1979, almost Rogers&#39; entire solo career.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Jacobs&#39; roots are in classic rock and roll and jazz. He always thought he would play in a rock and roll band or jazz setting. Jacobs played in several bands before joining up with Kenny Rogers touring with R&amp;B legend Hank Ballard, Wayne Cochran &amp; the CC Riders and playing in a jazz trio based in NYC up until 1979 when that all changed. Almost on a whim, he told an old band-mate who played with Kenny Rogers, that he might be interested in playing bass for him.  He was invited to meet Kenny, who was impressed enough that he hired Chuck right away.  That was in January of 1979 and Jacobs has been playing with Rogers ever since, and has played on many of Rogers&#39; records and all of his live TV shows and tours totaling over 5000 performances world-wide.

His work with Kenny Rogers has led him to play with many huge stars, and his rock solid professionalism always provides great consistent bass lines. When he feels like experimenting a little more, he also plays in a jazz band, The Jacobs Brothers, with his brothers Dan and Rod Jacobs and guitarist Randy Dorman from Kenny Rogers&#39; band.
Kenny Rogers has always been very encouraging of side projects, and most of the band has other projects to fill the time between gigs.
Another of Chuck Jacobs&#39; side project is probasslines.com, where he offers up his services for anyone who might need a professional bass line for a project. You send him your music and a description of what you need, and he returns a bass track for you to use.
Besides his own playing, Jacobs has produced more than 30 artists through the record label he has with his brother Dan. Chuck Jacobs has also published several books on playing bass.

Chuck Jacobs uses the Amazing TC Electronic RH450 Bass Amp. It lets him dial in his tone and settings like no other compact amp, and of course, the sound is amazing.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Jack Lee is a world renowned jazz guitarist from Korea.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Born and raised in Seoul, Korea, Jack Lee is one of the most internationally renowned and respected Korean guitarists.

Jack Lee&#39;s musical heritage is a mix of the local Asian influences and an early exposure to rock artists like Hendrix and Clapton, combined with a deep love and interest for the jazzier sounds of people like Miles Davis.

When he was 17 he moved to New York to develop his talents. While studying computer science at Columbia University, he took the time to soak in the rich jazz history the city has to offer and began honing his guitar skills, which would later see him team up with some of the best known names in jazz. After graduating from Columbia he has toured the world as a professional musician making his mark on the jazz scene in both New York and the rest of the world.
His career has led him to play with such musicians as pianist Bob James, bass legend Nathan East, drummer Harvey Mason, and many more during the last twenty years.

Jack Lee is without any doubt one of the world&#39;s top jazz guitarists at the moment, and his skill is immediately apparent, but not ostentatious or in your face. His music rewards the attentive listener, who cares to listen for the wealth of details that can be found in his unique and intricate playing style that still manages to hold a gentle and lyrical flow, which instantly grabs the listeners by the heart.

On top of his work as the perfect sideman for the greats, Jack Lee also has his own world music ensemble, Asianergy. This eclectic ensemble departs somewhat from his jazzy roots by blending his love for jazz with more regional sounds from all over Asia and South America.
He has drawn upon the many connections he has made, while playing all over the world, to find some of the best and most interesting musicians from around the globe, to play with Asianergy.

Jack Lee has released 12 albums, among them are Asianergy 1 and 2.

Jack Lee incorporates several different products from TC Electronic, to achieve his sound. And because the pedals are transparent, he can incorporate all of them or none of them on a case by case basis, as he sees fit.]]></artistBio2>

Bass					</artistSegment>
					<artistBio><![CDATA[Nobody plays the bass quite like Bootsy Collins, and nobody looks like Bootsy Collins. The legendary funk bassist is perhaps the actual definition of &#39;funk icon&#39;.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Rising to prominence as a bassist in James Brown&#39;s band, and later with George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Bootsy has been incredibly prolific throughout his career. Besides playing the bass like a funky angel, he sings and writes songs as well, and he has put out more than 20 albums combined with his band Bootsy&#39;s Rubber Band and as a solo artist. Besides that, he has appeared on countless albums from other artists.

Among the greatest and most influential bass players in popular music, he has said, that he wanted to play bass like Jimi Hendrix played guitar. Hence, Bootsy started off playing guitar, like his idol and like his older brother Catfish Collins, but one day his brother&#39;s bassist couldn&#39;t make it to a gig, so Bootsy grabbed a bass, and filled in. It just felt right, and Bootsy hasn&#39;t looked back since.

Bootsy was starting out in music around the time James Brown came out with Papa&#39;s Got a Brand New Bag. As arguably the first distinct funk-song it made a deep impression on the young Bootsy Collins. So when he found himself playing with Brown a few years later, he was well aware how lucky he was.

When Bootsy started playing with James Brown, Brown was already an icon. A perfectionist, and famously hard taskmaster, James Brown would often tell the band &#39;you just ain&#39;t got it&#39; after even very successful gigs, and would continually push them towards perfection. The thing Bootsy is most grateful to have learned from James Brown, is the importance of emphasising the &#39;one&#39; beat. That focus is the deceptively simple engine for true funk. 
Eventually Bootsy ended up leaving James Brown&#39;s band, the J.B.&#39;s, with his brother, Catfish Collins. It wasn&#39;t long however, before they joined George Clinton&#39;s legendary Parliament-Funkadelic collective, where Bootsy was a central figure for many years.
Contrary to the perfectionist James Brown, Clinton encouraged experimentation, which gave Bootsy room to really shine. He started hooking up all kinds of different pedals to his rig, and really began experimenting with sound, and he has continued to do so to this very day. Among Bootsy&#39;s many effect pedals, you find the Flashback X4 Delay, which he really likes for the great sound, effortless flexibility, and quick access to presets.

Since 1975 Bootsy has been known for his outlandish star shaped sunglasses, shiny clothes, and the funky looking star shaped Space Bass, which makes him very easy to spot in any crowd, but Bootsy&#39;s amazing tone and unique playing style makes him equally easy to spot with your eyes closed. Bootsy Collins, has done as much as anyone to shape the sound of funk through his career with James Brown&#39;s band, Parliament-Funkadelic and as a solo artist, and this massive effort finally got rewarded in 1997 where he got inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with 15 other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.
	
One of his current projects is to ensure that the world stays funky. To that end Bootsy has founded the online Funk University, where intermediate to advanced funk hopefuls can get funked up. At Funk U, Professor Collins delivers weekly lectures along with daily lectures and lessons from other top musicians in funk.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Johnny Hiland was practically born with a guitar in his hand and with bluegrass music in his blood. At the tender age of ten, he won a talent show that put him in front of an audience in New York City. At that time he&#39;d already been touring with the family band for several years.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[A bluegrass picking marvel, Hiland is born legally blind, so there were a lot of the things his friends could do, that he never really could. This led him to the guitar when he was just two years old. Since his childhood Hiland has branched out from bluegrass, owing to the influence of rock guitarists like Eddie Van Halen and Joe Satriani, who he was exposed to in high school.
In 1996 he moved to Nashville, and he quickly became a well-known face at several local clubs, which later earned him a residency at the famous Turf club, and as if that wasn&#39;t enough he was also the first unsigned artist in Nashville to get an endorsement deal with Fender. 

It was while living and playing in Nashville that Steve Vai heard Hiland&#39;s playing, and offered to sign him to his Favored Nations label. His self-titled debut album came out in 2004. By that time he was also a busy session musician in Nashville. He has recorded with Ricky Skaggs, Lynn Anderson, Toby Keith and many others. 

In 2011 he signed with Shrapnel Records putting out the record &#39;All Fired Up&#39; where he once again shows off his hybrid picking that exhibits both his other-worldly speed and uncanny precision. On &#39;All Fired Up&#39; he once again demonstrate his chops with a mix of chicken picking, heavy rock, country and pop.

Johnny Hiland loves to teach, and he continues to give private guitar lessons. He has also made several instructional videos, teaching different guitar skills, mainly chicken picking, which is something of a specialty of his. 

Throughout the years Johnny has toured with his own band, The Johnny Hiland Band, as well as playing with artists like Sammy Hagar Ted Nugent, George Clinton, Joe Bonamassa, Steve Vai, and many more.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Dave Beste joined Rival Sons in august 2013 when previous bassist Robin Everhart left. It&#39;s a rock band of the old school. The focus is on raw energy, big riffs and face-melting power vocals.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Rival Sons is a classic rock band in the best sense of the word. The sound harks back to the likes of Led Zeppelin with epic riffs, groovy bass lines, catchy tunes, and powerful vocals. It&#39;s the kind of powerful, raw rock &#39;n&#39; roll you don&#39;t really see much anymore. The kind of rock that should be filling the airwaves and stadiums across the world, but doesn&#39;t seem to do that like it used to.

The band is trying to change that and bring rock back to the people. They plan to meet those people on the road, where they are always well received. It was the intensive touring lifestyle that became too much for the band&#39;s original bassist, but luckily touring is exactly what Dave Beste loves to do. He loves waking up in a new city, ready to rock. So when Robin Everhart left, singer Jay Buchanan asked his friend Dave Beste to join for the upcoming tour. The tour went off without a hitch, and by the end of it, Dave had become an official Rival Son.

When he first started playing with the band, he deliberately tried to play as much like Robin Everhart as possible. However, after his stint with Rival Sons became a more permanent arrangement, he began putting more of a personal touch on the grooves, which you can hear on the band&#39;s newest record, although it&#39;s still unmistakably Rival Sons.

Dave Beste is originally from Lincoln, Nebraska, which has a vibrant music scene. Beste credits much of his musical development to the live music environment in Lincoln, where he lived until 2000, when he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a professional music career. 
He draws his personal inspiration from a wide range of artists, and has mentioned Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Marvin Gaye, James Brown, and The Police as some of his favorite artists.

The latest record from Rival Sons, Hollow Bones, came out in the summer of 2016 and has been met with critical acclaim as well as some very happy fans.]]></artistBio2>

Before Periphery&#39;s rise to fame, Misha Mansoor ruled the internet under his online pseudonym, Bulb where he relentlessly churned out songs and demos for the metal-hungry crowd. This resulted in over 100 home-recorded demos and song ideas, and a vast knowledge about sounds and recording techniques.

Mansoor&#39;s influences range from Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah to British guitar virtuosos Allan Holdsworth and Guthrie Govan to shred-legend John Petrucci of Dream Theatre. But a more surprising musical inspiration is the Japanese pianist and composer Nobuo Uematsu, who is known for his insane sense of melodies and beautiful arrangements in the Final Fantasy video game series.

Mansoor is a self-proclaimed gear junky and is constantly on the lookout for new and interesting sounds that he can use in his compositions. Hence you&#39;ll frequently catch him online talking about and discussing the gear that creates the unlimited sound image that is Misha Mansoor.

Misha has been a long-time TC Electronic fan, and has been using the original SCF Stereo Chorus pedal for years now. Recently the Flashback Delay and Ditto X2 Looper have made their way to his home studio and are great tools in his songwriting process.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Mark Holcomb is lead guitarist in the modern progressive metal band Periphery and his heavy killer-riffs can also be experienced in the extreme metal duo Haunted Shores, a studio project with fellow Periphery lead guitarist Misha Mansoor.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Up until the age of 13 all Mark wanted was to play basketball, (un)luckily he tore his MCL ligament in his knee and was laid out for half a year without being able to do anything physically. During this time he watched a Foo Fighters Live Special on MTV and Dave Grohl&#39;s charisma and enthusiasm as a performer convinced Mark to start playing the guitar - and boy are we thrilled about that decision!  

Dave Grohl being his gateway into music, metal-guitar-legends like James Hetfield of Metallica, Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, and the late Randy Rhoads were the &#39;hard drugs&#39; of his musical inspiration. Especially Metallica was such an inspiration that Mark started out learning the entirety of Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning on guitar. From that point Mark got into death metal, black metal, and other types of extreme stuff.

In the early 2000&#39;s Mark moved to Washington DC and started to hang out with the Periphery guys - in particular fellow guitarist Misha Mansoor. They started the studio project Haunted Shores, where they released songs online for a couple of years, and one time in 2011 during Periphery&#39;s tour in Australia Mark was asked to fill-in on guitar. Knowing Periphery so well, this super-sub quickly became a permanent member in the Periphery starting line-up!

Since Mark joined Periphery they have released 3 studio albums and toured the world multiple times. Mark and Misha are currently finishing up a new Haunted Shores album, which is going to be, according to Mark, way more negative than older HS and worlds faster and darker than Periphery - an album to look forward to!

In 2013, they officially announced a new single called &quot;Melodic Punks Not Dead!!!&quot; under the band name NAMBA69.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Harshit &#39;Hashbass&#39; Misra is currently one of youngest in demand bass players out there in the world today. Having studied under the greats, plus his vast musical knowledge combined with an unbelievable work ethic and super solid grooves is what makes Hashbass a true rising star. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Hashbass is the living proof of that if you follow your passion and if you work hard then your wildest dreams will come true. While studying to become a mechanical engineer, Hashbass quickly realized that he couldn&#39;t hold back his love for music, and simply had to follow that dream through. Luckily, fate would have it that shortly after quitting his mechanical engineer study a chance for admission to the School of Audio Engineering in Chennai appeared, and Hashbass gained entry to the career path of his dreams. After only 4 months at the new college he was offered a spot as the bass player for local prog.rock act (83 MPH), and from there on there was no stopping. Hashbass practiced tirelessly and soon the awards for his solid bass playing began rolling in. Together with (83MPH) he won India&#39;s biggest band competition, Channel V Launch Pad, and along the way he garnered tons of accolades himself, included several Best Bass Player awards at college and at professional competitions.

But again fate would see to that Hashbass could take his career to the next level, when he suddenly got the chance to compete for a full scholarship at the Musician Institute of Los Angeles. Hashbass finished second, which earned him a part scholarship and the chance to study under some of the finest musicians in Los Angeles. In 2014 he won an Outstanding Student award, which saw him become a faculty member at the Musician Institute.


Hashbass loves to bring all kinds of musical vibes and flavors to the table, which his musical inspirations clearly show as they range from Yellow Jacket to J Dilla to Gospel to Ravi Shankar. During his 7 years as a session player he&#39;s been fortunate to play with acts like Candice Glover (American Idol Winner), Wayne Brady, Girl Radical and Grammy Award winner, Jackie Boyz.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Two-time GRAMMY nominee Tommy Emmanuel is one of the world&#39;s most respected musicians. With a professional career spanning five decades, Tommy has garnered hundreds of thousands of loyal fans worldwide on account of his breathtaking musicianship.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Give a listen to &#39;Old Photographs,&#39; the closing track on Tommy Emmanuel&#39;s It&#39;s Never Too Late, and you&#39;ll hear the distinctive squeak of finger noise as he runs his hands across the frets of his Maton Signature TE guitar. Many musicians would edit those imperfections out, but to Emmanuel, those imperfections are perfect.
	A master technician, Emmanuel started professionally at age 6, rising through the ranks as a studio player and member of several Australian rock bands before he set off on a solo career. One of only five musicians handpicked by his mentor, Chet Atkins, as a Certified Guitar Player (CGP), he&#39;s piled up numerous accolades, including two Grammy nominations, two ARIA Awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association (the Aussie equivalent of the Recording Academy) and repeated honors in the Guitar Player magazine reader&#39;s poll.
	A noted fingerstyle guitarist,  Emmanuel frequently threads three different parts simultaneously into his material, operating as a one-man band who handles the melody, the supporting chords and the bass all at once. His talents, which translate in any language, carry him to the far corners of the globe, but Emmanuel never plays the same show twice, and he improvises big chunks of every date. That leaves him open to those technical imperfections, though they also provide some of the humanity to an other-worldly talent.

	&#39;It&#39;s all about the feeling of the music,&#39; Emmanuel says. &#39;And it has to make me feel something. I&#39;m still playing for myself, you know, because I figure if I please me, then I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m gonna please you. And that&#39;s not an arrogant statement, it&#39;s just quality control.&#39;]]></artistBio2>

Tres Gilbert is a huge TC-fan and when asked the question by James Ross from www.jross-tv.com: &#39;Why did you choose TC?&#39; Tres&#39; answer was simply: &#39;Honestly it&#39;s just pure… you can feel it, it&#39;s very transparent, the EQ is bananas, the tuner is all the way crazy, the toneprints are like ice cream with cherries on top… &#39;

					<artistBio><![CDATA[The hardest working man in the music business, Mr.Nashville Session Musician Himself, Brent Mason is one of the most in-demand guitarists in Country Music. The multiple times Country Guitarist of the Year Award winner has been a game changer for a long time and he&#39;ll remain one for even longer!]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Growing up in a musical family, Mason had the perfect starting point growing up. 
Displaying his astonishing talent, the natural born guitarist taught himself to play the guitar at the age of 5 and he hasn&#39;t looked back ever since! After graduating from high school in 1977 Mason took the Country capital of the world Nashville with storm, where early gigs included a stint with the Don Kelley Band - a band that has since become an incubator for great Nashville musicians like John Hiland, Guthrie Trapp, JD Simo, and most recently Daniel Donato. 

Multiple Grammy award winner, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Chet Atkins, then discovered Mason and invited him to play on his Stay Tuned album that included other guitar giants like Mark Knofler, George Benson, Earl Klugh, and many more. From there on Mason was unstoppable appearing on well over a thousand other artist albums including those of George Strait, Alan Jackson, Shania Twain, Scotty McCreary, Blake Sheldon and Neil Diamond. 

In 1997 he released his only major-label album Hot Wired, which earned him a Grammy nomination. In 2006 Mason and his brother released a second album, entitled Smokin&#39; Section. The hard work paid off in 2009 where he won a Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental alongside other guitarist for the track &#39;Cluster Pluck&#39; from Brad Paisley&#39;s album Play. In 2011 Brent Mason was rightfully inducted into the National Thumbpickers Hall of Fame!

Mason continues to create his magic as a studio musician and he is sharing some of his magic tricks as he has made a series of guitar lessons on JamPlay for aspiring guitarist.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Daniel Donato is nothing short of a guitar prodigy, and at the tender age of 20 he is currently seen as one of the hottest names in the Nashville Country scene where he&#39;s currently playing with the Don Kelley Band.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Born in 1995, Daniel Donato is spearheading an entirely new breed of guitarists who is introduced to the glorious world of rock through computer games. Through Guitar Hero, Daniel picked up an interest for the sound of classic rock giants like Led Zeppelin, Queen and Guns N&#39; Roses, and immediately after hearing Gn&#39;R&#39;s smash-hit &#39;Paradise City&#39; an inner light went on - his love for music had officially been lit!

Ever since then Daniel Donato has put in the work to master the music of his heroes, practising absurd amounts of hours to nail every detail from tones to licks. But what started out as a love for classic rock quickly turned to a passion for country after being invited to sit in with a local Nashville band during a live gig at the age of 14. That was the first time he ever played a Telecaster, and the experience of playing the Tele for the first time and playing that kind of music just resonated deeply with him. Then after watching JD Simo play with the Don Kelly Band there was no turning back. This was what he wanted to do with his life - play music for a living!

Now, Daniel Donato is filling the shoes of his heroes and leaving his own mark on the Nashville scene as he has taken the spot as lead guitarist for the Don Kelley Band. This band is seen as the main incubator for the best guitarists Nashville has to offer since prominent names like Brent Mason, Johnny Hiland, Guthrie Trapp and JD Simo have once stood where Daniel is standing now.

The Don Kelley Band is a gig that lets Daniel decide where he wants to grow as a player, and ever since joining; Daniel has just gone from strength to strength. So much so that Daniel&#39;s next goal is to finally get his own music down on tape for the world to hear.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[This multitalented string virtuoso is one to pay attention to in the near future! Not only is Cody Wright the bass player in Jonathan Scales Fourchestra he&#39;s also the guitarist in his own trio. Cody is becoming a world-class musician of the highest order.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a 4-5-year-old youngster he started singing along to the music of video games rather than playing the games. His parents then introduced him to all kinds of great jazz, blues, and rock music but it wasn&#39;t until he was 13 he picked up an instrument for real. He saved up for a keyboard but at the same time his nephew got an electric guitar - and when first heard how amazing the guitar sounded he was spell bounded! 

At the age of 17 Cody already mastered the guitar so much that he started playing as a special guest with the band The Chicken Head Blues Band in Charlottesville Virginia, kick starting his career. 

In 2011 Cody Wright was asked to audition as the bassist for the charismatic Jonathan Scales a steel drummer from Ashville. Being a guitarist he hesitated but ended up getting the gig and starting off his career as a bass player. Just 3 days after graduating from college he started touring with Jonathan Scales Fourchestra, which whom he released 2 studio albums with. During this musical fantasy ride Cody got to share the stage with legendary bassists like Victor Wooten and Oteil Burbridge.

As being the bassist in a successful recording band wasn&#39;t enough, Cody Wright is currently recording his first solo album &#39;A Bass Only a Mother Could Love&#39; which will be released in the fall of 2015. In the words of Victor Wooten: &#39;[Cody Wright is] Amazing and Musical!! Love it!!!&#39; - we agree!

					<artistBio><![CDATA[The best guitarist in Nashville? JD Simo blends the best elements of blazing, tasteful, authoritative country guitar with a great mix of the best of Cream-era Eric Clapton and a touch of Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac - with that recipe we are in for a full course meal in guitar heaven. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[In the words of the legendary blues rock guitarist Joe Bonamassa &#39;JD is one of the best out there right now!&#39;

As a 4-year-old tot JD Simo was impressed by the movie The Blues Brothers and Elvis Presley so naturally he wanted a guitar in his hands. Growing up near Chicago blues clubs in the mid 1980&#39;s, Simo caught the music bug early. By the age of 15 the highly determined Simo had already formed a band and released a live EP Burning Live that sold over 5000 copies. He quickly earned a strong local following in the Phoenix area. He spent most of his teenage years touring, either in his own solo endeavours or in various other bands.

In 2006 he moved his ambitions and hunger to Nashville and established himself as the lead guitarist in the Don Kelley Band. This band has been the main incubator for the best guitarist Nashville has to offer since prominent names like Brent Mason, Johnny Hiland, Guthrie Trapp and his now successor the fleet-fingered Daniel Donato. This led to a high demand on Simo&#39;s skills and sound and he got employed as a high-class session musician. 

In 2010 he joined his awesome forces with bassist Frank Swart and drummer Adam Abrashoff and formed the rock band SIMO. The band toured extensively and featured at several festivals including Mountain Jam and Bonaroo. Shaking of the demise of CDs, SIMO harkens back to the days when bands built followings not online, but night after night, show after show on stage.

SIMO like jam bands Phish and the Greatful Dead encourages fans to live-tape his shows and share them online, so fans of the band can share and recreate the live experience. 

Not only is Simo sharing his musical gifts through live appearances and studio albums, he also maintains an online blog, featuring videos of his playing style as well as information about vintage music equipment as a nice side-dish to an already perfect meal

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Co-founder and member of legendary Duran Duran, John Taylor, has been part of music history for over 35 years - and still counting. He originally started out playing guitar in Duran Duran, but quickly switched to bass - his main instrument ever since.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Young John Taylor wasn&#39;t an obvious soon-to-be rockstar being a boy from the suburb Hollywood, Birmingham, with an interest in wargaming with model-soldiers. But luckily that all changed in his early teens, when he discovered music. Soon he was collecting records and teaching himself to play piano.

In 1978 Taylor formed Duran Duran with school friend Nick Rhodes (synthesizers) and Stephen Duffy (vocals) with Taylor playing guitar. Shortly after he switched to bass as guitarist Andy Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor joined and the bands first bass player, Simon Colley, left. The band found what is known as the classic line-up in 1980, when vocalist Simon Le Bon joined.

Duran Duran released their first album &#39;Duran Duran&#39; in 1981, and since claimed worldwide success with hit songs such as &#39;Hungry Like The Wolf&#39;, &#39;Rio&#39; and &#39;Is There Something I Should Know&#39; in the first half of the 1980&#39;s. All songs with the signature, melodic, almost McCartney-like bass play of John Taylor which he to this day master to perfection and is widely known for.

In 1985 Duran Duran split into two side projects, and John and Andy Taylor formed the rock/funk group &#39;The Power Station&#39; with Chic drummer Tony Thompson and singer Robert Palmer. Together they made the album &#39;The Power Station&#39; showing a way more hard and funky side of John Taylors bass play - an early testimony of Taylor&#39;s versatility as a musician. 

In 1997 John Taylor left Duran Duran due to creative differences. The same year he released his first solo album &#39;Feelings Are Good (And Other Lies)&#39; at his own label B5 Records, collaborating with Steve Jones from Sex Pistols. The album revealed Taylors great talent for songwriting and singing. In the years that followed he released a couple of solo albums and toured with his band &#39;John Taylor Terroristen&#39;.

Duran Duran reunited in 2001 under the classic line-up. They did a very successful 25th anniversary tour and released a new album, Astronaut, in 2004. The band is still going strong and released their latest album, Paper Gods, in September 2015. ]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[From teenage heartthrob to blues-rock star to six-string slinger for the biggest names in rock history. Charlie Sexton has tried it all, and must be considered a full-blown guitar legend in his own right!]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Charlie and his brother Will got off to a great start with their music careers when they were taught to play the guitar by the &#39;Godfather of Austin Blues&#39; W. C. Clark as young unmoulded aspiring teenagers. Other local Austin musicians like Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughn helped Charlie develop his talents as a musician.

In 1985, at the age of only 16, Charlie&#39;s first solo full-length debut album Pictures for Pleasure was released including the Top 20 hit single Beat&#39;s So Lonely. Parallels to David Bowie were thrown at the teen idol and in 1987 those parallels shared a stage when Sexton occasionally opened for Bowie on his Glass Spider Tour.

Before reaching the tender age of 20, Sexton&#39;s great skills as a guitarist were in huge demand and he became a popular session player, recording with legendary artist such as Ronnie Wood and Keith Richard of the Rolling Stones, Don Henley founding member of the Eagles, and Bob Dylan. During this period he followed up his debut-album with the self-titled album Charles Sexton, recorded at the age of 20!

During the late 80s and 90s, Charlie Sexton was a very busy man. He released an album with his brother under the band name Will and the Kill, contributed songs to various movie soundtrack including True Romance, Air America, and Thelma &amp; Louise, formed the blues/rock band Arc Angels in 1992, next he formed the Charlie Sexton Sextet in 1995, and in the mean time Sexton continued to perform with other artist and appearing on notable albums as Lucinda Williams&#39; Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and Shawn Colvin&#39;s Grammy-winning album A Few Small Repairs.

In 1999, Bob Dylan hired Sexton and he toured with Dylan until 2002 hailing praises of being one of Dylan&#39;s best bands. They recorded a number of studio recordings, including Things Have Changed and the critically acclaimed album Love and Theft. Sexton then re-joined Dylan&#39;s band in 2009-2012 and again in 2013 up until now. 

Also in 2013 he joined Dave Matthews, Jakob Dylan and his own brother Will Sexton to form the band The Nauts and in 2014 Charlie Sexton played a role in the Golden Globe winning film Boyhood. Charlie Sexton has already had an amazing career and he will continue to amaze us in the future!]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[For people who like fusion with prominent guitar playing, the name Richard Hallebeek should sound familiar. His unique style and lyrical phrasing have solidified his position as one of the best within his genre, and have seen him collaborate with several jazz/fusion legends throughout his career.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Growing up in the small village of Bilthoven, Netherlands nothing pegged young Richard Hallebeek to become what he is now. Namely one of the greatest voices within the world of progressive jazz and fusion guitar. His parents weren&#39;t musicians, and even though they heard a lot of The Beatles and Frank Zappa at home, none of these huge innovators would become what tipped the musical scale for Richard. Instead it was the ubiquitous music show &#39;Top Of The Pops&#39; that saw lightning strike with Richard at the age of ten after witnessing energetic performances by Toto and Talking Heads on the show.

From that point on, there was no stopping him. Richard took up guitar instantly and became a self-proclaimed &#39;total guitar-nerd&#39;, dedicating every waking hour to the art of the six-string. He dove deep into the intricate and virtuoso guitar playing of Pat Matheny, Allan Holdsworth and Eddie Van Halen all while still maintaining a deep-rooted love for the catchy tunes of The Beatles. At age 12, Richard was already performing with various local jazz and rock outfits, and at the age of 17 he officially became the youngest guitar player ever to be accepted into the highly respected Hilversum Conservatory, where he studied with jazz legend, Wim Overgaauw.

He graduated with a master&#39;s degree in jazz, composition and improvisation. Not known to be standing still for too long, Richard decided to evolve his skills overseas by taking a one year course at the world renowned Los Angeles Music Institute, where he would find himself studying with none-other than Scott Henderson, Brett Garsed and Dan Gilbert.

Besides seeing his guitar skills rise to new levels of excellence, Richard&#39;s trip across the pond also taught him a valuable lesson. No matter where you live, you can&#39;t wait on your lucky break, you have to make things happen yourself!

This level of drive and dedication saw Richard Hallebeek record his critically acclaimed debut album &#39;Generator&#39; together with legendary guitarists Frank Gambale and Carl Verheyen, and former class mates Scott Henderson and Dan Gilbert.

From thereon Richard has gone from strength to strength acting as everything as an in demand session player, writer for the popular Dutch music magazine &#39;Music Maker&#39;, and the orchestrator behind his own ambitious music venture called the Richard Hallebeek Project, where his ultra-creative compositions has seen guest appearances by iconic guitarists such as Shawn Lane, Andy Timmons, Greg Howe, Guthrie Govan and Eric Gales.

Richard is a grand musical collaborator, and there&#39;s no doubt that his lyrical phrasing and spine-tinkling tones will grace several recordings to come.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[From blues-rock to jazz while crossing over into the world of classical compositions, London-based guitarist, Jake Willson is currently one the most exciting new voices in the world of guitar-oriented music.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[When you look at Jake Willson today, especially watching him perform in his electrifying Jamtrackcentral videos, it&#39;s hard to imagine that this guy actually tried to steer away from music during the first stages of life.

Jake grew up in a home full of music with a father who was a professional guitarist. But since every kid needs to go through a stage of rebellion, all Jake had to rebel against was music. Although he tried to push music aside, the guitar was destined to get a hold of him sooner or later. And when it did it got him good!

He started out listening to the raw and catchy riffs of Nirvana and Blink-182 and immediately began learning them on the guitar. But riffs quickly turned to intricate melodies, which led to scales, theory and a profound interest in jazz music.

He started taking lessons from a local jazz guitarist, and from that point on there was no going back. All he wanted to do was go all-in on music!

Hard work and an ambitious mind-set led young Jake to be accepted into the world-renowned Berklee College of Music in Boston, which has seen artists such as John Mayer, Steve Vai, John Scofield and John Petrucci walk the halls throughout the years.
 
Jake ended up completing his degree back home in England at the University of Surrey, where he began studying for a PhD in Classical Composition, while working as an associate lecturer in the fields of orchestration, jazz studies, performance and composition.

Jake&#39;s unpolluted love for music sees him play a vast array of genres live every day. One day you&#39;ll catch him playing eclectic fusion, the next he&#39;s unleashing a heart-felt blues-rock attack, and the third you&#39;ll catch him comping and laying down melodic phrases at jazz clubs across the country.

At the same time Jake has maintained a solid career as a classical composer, and his work has regularly been performed by world-class musicians.
 
We&#39;re almost getting short of breath just by listing Jake Willson&#39;s accomplishments so far, but luckily the man himself is unaffected and is currently pouring his heart and soul into his first solo album.

The future is certainly looking bright for this incredible six-string talent.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[From ferocious high-speed shredding to tender melancholic melodies, Jen Majura of modern-metal giants Evanescence covers it all, making her guitar playing as fierce, fearless and ambitious as herself.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Growing up in the southern parts of Germany, Jen&#39;s father had big musical hopes and dreams for his daughter. He envisioned a future where she would be one of the biggest modern classical piano players, gracing the world with her music, but young Jen had other plans. She wanted to rock &#39;n&#39; roll!

After hearing the infectious riffs and melodies of rock &#39;n&#39; roll legends, KISS there was no shadow of a doubt in Jen&#39;s mind about what she wanted to do with her life. She wanted to play the guitar, and she wanted to rock it like no-one else. So at the tender age of 7, Jen was already rippin&#39; her first power chords, and with the help of her favorite Ritchie Kotzen VHS tape, she quickly started to delve into the fast-paced world of shredding. At age 12 she had her first band up and running, and by her early teens she was playing in one of the most popular AC/DC tribute bands in her home country. On top of that she&#39;s played in the comical metal band, Knorkator and wielded a hard-hitting bass for German Black Metal outfit Equilibrium.

As you can probably tell, Jen isn&#39;t known for standing still. She is constantly evolving and moving forward, and it is this hyper-ambitious drive and her undeniable musical talent that saw her land the gig as the new guitarist for American goth-metal megastars, Evanescence in August 2015.

The Evanescence gig has already seen Jen&#39;s skills multiply tenfold at both ends of the musical spectrum. Baritone and extended-range guitars have made her tone heavier than ever, while getting more into spacious effects like chorus, reverb and delay for the quieter ambient parts of Evanscence music has taken her sound and melodic feel to new thrilling heights.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[John S. Konesky is a Grammy Award winning American guitarist, additional vocalist, producer and actor. He has been called a mythical guitar god and whether it is in Tenacious D, Trainwreck, The Kyle Gass Band or his solo work, his excellent guitar playing definitely lives up to the nickname.
]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Konesky was practically born with long hair and a full-grown moustache and has rocked the guitar ever since his hands could grab one. Okay, we&#39;re probably stretching the truth here, but honestly there was never any doubt in John&#39;s mind that his life&#39;s calling was music.

Throughout his teens he dedicated himself to guitar and nothing but guitar, basically living like a hermit in his own musical dream-sphere. But boy did it pay off!

At age 23 Konesky moved to Los Angeles in his pursuit of becoming a full-time musician, and basically just to jam with the best. This led to him meeting Kyle Gass who invited him to join his comical hard rock band Trainwreck. 

Trainwreck was the first big piece in the puzzle that created John&#39;s musical destiny. The next piece was put in place when Kyle introduced John to his good friend Jack. Jack Black that is. This resulted in Konesky quickly landing the job as full-time &#39;stunt-guitarist&#39; for the biggest comic-rock act to walk the earth, namely Tenacious D. John played a major role in the making of the soundtrack to Tenacious D&#39;s cult-movie &#39;The Pick Of Destiny&#39;, while laying down lead guitar on their 2012 record &#39;Rize Of The Fenix&#39;.
 
As Trainwreck eventually broke up, John and Kyle started an online show titled Guitarings, which is basically a show about guitars and how to be awesome while playing them. Later on, John was invited by Kyle Gass to join his self-titled band &#39;The Kyle Gass band&#39; in which John acts as the lead guitarist.

Aside from all of these projects that see John apply his talents to the work of others, he also released his own masterpiece in 2009. A folk album titled &#39;Kones&#39;. Though he&#39;s mostly known for playing leads, Konesky&#39;s true passion lies in chords, harmonies and finger-style guitar, which is exactly what the album is about. It features nothing more than himself, his acoustic guitar and a truck-load of emotions.

When it comes to guitar pedals and effects John is a minimalist and goes for the tiniest pedals he can find and only gets the stuff he needs to do his thing. 
But then again, why would anyone need a sea of effects if you were like John Konesky, a satanically good guitar player.

Today John Konesky is still a resident in L.A. where he has his own studio. He&#39;s still holding down the fort as Tenacious D&#39;s live guitarist while occupying the permanent spot as lead guitarist in both The Kyle Gass Band and in the band Big Talk. To round it all off, he&#39;s working on a follow-up to his debut album. The world definitely hasn&#39;t seen the last of John and his six-string talents.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Jonathan Hischke is a bass player who&#39;s not afraid to dive head first into sounds that seem peculiar, if not downright obscene. He&#39;s here to challenge the traditional way a bass player approaches his instrument. He&#39;s here to make some noise!]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Whether his year-long stint in the band Hella, or the hundreds of other bands and projects he has starred in, the man is undeniably good at what he does.

Jonathan grew up in a highly musical family, with a dad who was a professional musician. He was brought up on an eclectic musical mix which included everything from the intelligent pop-tunes of Stevie Wonder to the prog-rock sounds of Weather Report. What all of the music had in common though was their extremely synthesizer-heavy approach, which affected Jonathan profoundly.
Because when Hischke picked up the bass guitar as a young teenager, he immediately sought to make it sound like those otherworldly synths from his childhood. 

This hunt for sounds and textures instead of generic roots and fifths, quickly instilled a huge love for pedals and effects in Jonathan, and an admiration for the diverse bass playing of Jah Wobble, Tina Weymouth, Bernard Edwards which Jonathan defines as &#39;players who find interesting and personal ways of sitting in their musical context.&#39;

As Hischke went to Chicago his musical career started picking up speed.
Here he toured with math/noise rockers Hella, tracked with retro-garage band Agent Ribbons, made records with Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Big Sir and much much more, which further shaped Hischke into the alternative groove-machine he is today.
 
In 2008 he moved to L.A. and formed the groove-heavy alt-rock band Dot Hacker with Red Hot Chili Pepper&#39;s guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. Together they&#39;ve released three albums that effortlessly fuse everything from laid-back acoustics to full-on distorted wall of sounds, perfectly displaying Jonathan&#39;s versatility as a player. Later on he joined up with James Mercer and Danger Mouse of Broken Bells to serve as their live performance bass player, with whom he&#39;s still throwing down the synth-heavy grooves today.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Troy McLawhorn has left his mark on the alternative rock and metal scene of the early noughties, contributing his axe-wielding skills to acts such as doubleDrive, Sevendust, Dark New Day, Seether and Evanescence.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Having played the guitar since junior high, McLawhorn moved to Atlanta from Fayetteville, North Carolina, in the beginning of the 90s  with his friends and progressed from playing in cover bands to playing original music.

Early on he was inspired by bands such as Kiss and Black Sabbath, before he found his true inspiration in two of the 80s most iconic players: Eddie Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. 

&quot;Those two guy really inspired me,&quot; he tells. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say they influenced me so much, because I don&#39;t play like those guys. But they inspired me a lot.&quot;

In 1998 he signed to MCA with his first band doubleDrive, scoring a hit with the song &quot;Tattooed Bruise&quot;. For their second album they changed labels to Road Runner and had another rock-hit with the song &quot;Imprint&quot;.

When the band broke up in 2003, McLawhorn joined forces with his two friends, Clint Lowery of Sevendust and drummer Will Hunt. The band Dark New Day signed to Warner Brothers and released their debut album in 2005.

They toured with the alternative rock act Seether, which eventually lead McLawhorn to Evanescence. He was called upon to join the modern metal band fronted by Amy Lee on their 2007 tour. 

When the tour ended, the band went on a three year hiatus and McLawhorn joined Seether in the meantime, writing and recording an album with them, &quot;Holding on to Better Things Left to Fray&quot; released in 2011.

That same year he returned to Evanescence and played on their third, self-titled album. Since then he has kept busy being on tour with the band and as a producer, songwriter and session player.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Born in Britain, but raised in Brooklyn, New York by Caribbean parents with a big penchant for music, literature and art, Vernon Reid was basically raised on all the cultural wonders the world has to offer.

At home, Vernon&#39;s parents played everything from American Motown music like James Brown to leaders of the British Invasion, The Beatles and Dave Clarke Five, and all the way to native Caribbean songs, which infused Vernon with a huge love for music early on. But it wasn&#39;t before he heard the sweet singing sustain of Carlos Santana&#39;s six-string magic that he knew that he just had to learn how to play the guitar.

From there a massive musical journey began, seeing Vernon diving deeper into the world of John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix while attending a jazz workshop at school. This workshop went on and changed his life forever, opening his eyes to how music can do more than just entertain. It can actually influence people, change minds and transform experiences. 
And that&#39;s exactly what Vernon has been doing ever since through his music. The result being the legendary four-piece and funk-metal pioneers, Living Colour, founded by Vernon in 1984.

Living Colour became the canvas on which Vernon could paint with his multi-colored sonic strokes, creating a cult of diversity where everything was allowed. That&#39;s probably why Living Colour sky-rocketed over night with their debut release &#39;Vivid&#39; containing the smash-hit &#39;Cult Of Personality&#39;.
Vivid was a melting-pot of everything Vernon knew and loved, which made jumping from hardcore punk riffs to catchy pop melodies, Delta Blues licks and jazzy solos as natural as breathing, and it quickly became the standard of reference within the world of alternative metal.

Living Colour managed to release three albums and receive two Grammy awards before they disbanded in 1995, but that didn&#39;t put a stop to Vernon Reid&#39;s inexhaustible creativity. 

After the breakup, Vernon delved into a career as a solo artist and as a record producer for other acts, where the latter resulted in two Grammy nominations. Besides recording solo albums, Vernon also put his wide-ranging guitar skills to good use doing session work for artists at all ends of the musical spectrum like The Roots, Mick Jagger, Public Enemy, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Tracy Chapman and childhood idol, Santana just to mention a few.

In 2000, Vernon Reid and the rest of the Living Colour members reformed and subsequently released two albums in 2003 and 2009, while earning Vernon Reid a spot on Rolling Stone magazine&#39;s 2004 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. 

There&#39;s no doubt that Vernon Reid has already solidified his status as a true guitar legend, and time will only see his sonic kaleidoscopic colors shine even stronger.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[With a unique funky playing style, an angelic singing voice and an extremely powerful stage presence, Nik West is currently one of the hottest names on the bass scene.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Nik West started her musical journey in her hometown of Phoenix.
She was raised in a family full of music and creativity, and her father, an accomplished guitarist, taught Nik how to play the guitar at the tender age of thirteen.

She quickly began using her obvious talent for music by playing and singing in church. Here she got introduced to gospel music, which ended up teaching her one of the most important musical lessons ever - feeling always trumps skill and technique.

Nik stuck with the guitar for a while, and thought that was where she belonged. That all changed the day she heard the groovy pumping bass line on Michael Jackson&#39;s smash hit &#39;You Wanna Be Starting Somethin&#39;&#39;. That bass line is a hard-hitter and it hit Nik hard!

She immediately asked her father for a bass. He went to the local pawnshop, and bought her a $50 bass. Those $50 has later shown to be the best investment ever made into Nik&#39;s future, since she hasn&#39;t stopped playing the bass since the moment she got it.

Throughout the years, Nik has kept honing her left-handed bass skills all while taking her already amazing singing voice to new soulful heights, making her one of the most well-rounded artists currently on the scene.

Her unique talent has brought her a lot of attention, where Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics, was one of the first to fall head over heels in love with her expressive singing. This has resulted in the two of them working on several projects together throughout the years.

Nik blew away her listeners, with her debut solo album &#39;Just In The Nik Of Time&#39;, which features herself as bassist and lead singer. The album is a seamless combination of funky grooves, jazzy singing and catchy melodies, and is all in all a superb album. 

She has performed and worked as a bassist and background singer with tons of high-profile artists such as: Prince, John Mayer, Marcus Miller, Dave Stewart etc, and she&#39;s been highly praised by anyone she&#39;s ever worked with.

Nik has achieved all of this at a very young age, and it seems like this shooting bass star is just getting started!

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Will Nuruwe is an ultra-versatile Dutch bass player who effortlessly switches between jazz, funk, soul and rock. This has seen him share the stage with some of the biggest international and local acts within the world of music.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Will Nuruwe grew up in an extremely musical household in the Netherlands, where both of his parents loved to listen to and play music. This saw young Will being bitten by the music-bug very early on after his dad placed an acoustic guitar in his hands at the tender age of six.

Even though that classical guitar was way too big for Will&#39;s hands to hold at the time, he didn&#39;t give up, which paints a perfect picture of Will Nuruwe&#39;s ambitious and tenacious personality at a very young age.

These character traits have seen Will Nuruwe transform in several ways ever since. First, after learning the guitar, he decided to take on the groovy world of bass. His affection for this instrument grew rapidly seeing him decide to chase a career as a pro musician by studying the bass guitar at the Dutch Music  Conservatory.

Will Nuruwe kept progressing as a musician by playing as many diverse gigs as possible during his time at the conservatory, seeing him master everything from Jazz to Soul and R&amp;B and all the way to full-on rock grooves.

Hence it&#39;s no wonder that Will has had the pleasure of playing with a lot of different acts after he graduated. Among them are huge American acts like Mike Stern and Neal Schon (Journey), but also big Dutch acts like Edsilia Rombley, Bob Color and Total Touch, all while finding the time to run his solo-project, Will Nuruwe &amp; Friends on the side.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Born and raised in London, England in a home full of music and with a sweet Telecaster hanging on the wall, young Paul Sayer grew up under all the right conditions for becoming one badass musician. Fast forward to today, and Paul has achieved just that with his band The Temperance Movement.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Paul&#39;s musical journey officially began when he one day picked up that sweet Telecaster belonging to his dad, strummed his first chord and got bitten by the music bug big time. This led to Paul trawling the local record shops endlessly together with his dad, constantly on the look for new and old music alike that could fuel his craving for inspiring tones and ingenious guitar work.

In those shops he discovered the riveting and honest guitar work of players like Freddie King, Peter Green, Keith Richards and Jimmy Page, and instantly found a deep inner connection with their playing.

As Paul grew so did his skills on the six-string, which quickly saw him become an in-demand session and tour player. This resulted in Paul hitting the road with big British acts like Just Jack, Lily Allen, Ray Davies and Rea Garvey before he in 2011 felt that it was time to get his own songwriting out on record.

This saw him found the Temperance Movement together with Phil Campbell and Luke Potashnick, which found a common musical language in their honest and hard-hitting rock and roll roots, seeing Paul&#39;s no-frills approach to guitar reach new majestic heights.

They released their self-titled debut album in 2013 and followed up with their sophomore release in &#39;White Bear&#39; in 2016. Both albums hit home with listeners across the world, and in their home country they both managed to enter the UK Top 10 chart.

In 2014/15 The Temperance Movement were personally invited by rock icon, Mick Jagger to join The Rolling Stones on tour, and along the way guitar-god, Jimmy Page has declared himself a true Temperance Movement believer, seeing Paul going full-circle as the musicians he once looked up to and learned so much from now praised his work as a guitarist and songwriter.

We&#39;re sure that the praise and accolades will keep rolling in for Paul and the rest of The Temperance Movement in the future to come.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Self-taught on the bass, MonoNeon&#39;s killer groove and endless string of over-the-barline fills have left both audiences and fellow bass players jaw-to-the-floor.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Dywane Thomas Jr., known to most under his MonoNeon moniker, grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. Surrounded by strong traditions in the Blues City, he developed an early interest in music - and with his father an established bass player himself, the funk was never more than a muted note away.

At the age of four, young Dywane started finding his way around his instrument, eventually settling on his distinct style of playing the bass guitar upside-down, lowest string at the bottom. This technique allows him to use heavy bending on the top strings, an integral part of the MonoNeon signature sound.

His original tone paired with a strong sense of melody and absolute mastery of complex rhythms has seen him share the stage and studio with artists such as David &#39;Fuze&#39; Fiuczynski, Tye Tribbett, Judith Hill and Ne-Yo, as well as collaborations with funk icon Prince.

Aside from the heavy influence from the southern soul and blues scene, MonoNeon also picks up on the experimental vibe from minimalist composers like John Cage and the ornamentations of Indian classical music.

These are especially evident with the videos of his massive YouTube channel, where media snippets and viral videos are mimicked into magic, mind-bending and truly extraordinary masterpieces.

MonoNeon is a one-of-a-kind of musician. One that everybody truly should not miss out on.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Blazing trails more often than not, metal legend Bill Steer has fire-branded his mark onto numerous genre-defining albums, always throwing the shred quotients completely off the charts while retaining a strong sense of melody.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Never exactly a subtle band, UK pioneers Carcass have led the way of extreme metal since their outset in the mid 80s. And although Jeff Walker&#39;s tongue-twisting vocals are prominent on their records, it&#39;s not really Carcass until Bill Steer picks up the guitar.

His down-tuned death&#39;n&#39;roll riffs always add a great deal of depth to the band&#39;s sound and where other lead-guitarist sometimes come across as forced in their melodies, Steer always ends up with an extremely vicious yet human tone.

Much the same can be said of his purebred bite and pinpoint soloing with Gentlemans Pistols and his ferocious crunch with the criminally underrated blues-rock trio Firebird. When in his playful corner, Steer always brings the best of heavy metal classicism to any stage and studio.

After ten years of down-tuned grind, Carcass went on an extended hiatus from 96 until their return to recording with 2013&#39;s Surgical Steel.

As hoped, the long-awaited album took the weight of anticipation by the scruff of the neck and tore it apart, limb from limb, resulting in one of the greatest reunion albums of all time.

Since their rebirth, Carcass has headlined metal festivals all over the world and is quietly (as quiet as Carcass gets) working on new material that might become the heavy filth of another cornerstone album in metal.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Scott Holiday is the riff happy lead guitarist of the American blues rock band Rival Sons. He is also a former member of the bands Human Lab and Black Summer Crush. And, a self-proclaimed guitar dork.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As the first decade of the 00s were coming to an end, rock music was in desperate need of a roll. 

From out of nowhere - or so it seemed - the debut album from Rival Sons hit the airwaves in 2009 and ushered in a new prominence for honest, visceral and dangerous fuzz-driven rock n roll.

Any guitar aficionado will tell you that paramount to a thrilling rock n roll tune is the gut punching guitar riff. It is not only the body of the beast, but also the very soul of the song itself. 

And in hotshot guitarist Scott Holiday, Rival Sons has a man capable of delivering the goods, time and again.

From &#39;Before the Fire&#39; and the seminal &#39;Pressure &amp; Time&#39; to the much lauded &#39;Great Western Valkyrie&#39; and last year&#39;s &#39;Hollow Bones&#39;, every offering from the California band is generously strewn with Holiday&#39;s standout riffs. 

How &#39;bout the immediacy of &#39;Pressure &amp; Time&#39;? The Zeppelin-hot cooker &#39;Get What&#39;s Coming&#39; or the sexy swagger of &#39;Electric Man&#39;. All reminders of the embodiment of rock&#39;n&#39;roll in its purest form:

It&#39;s organically bred in cramped up and sweaty rehearsal spaces with the aid of warm tube amps burning bright against the damp wall, you see the flickering shape of an iconic guitar strung across the waist, whilst the player is dripping with soul and attitude, and the band&#39;s rebellious streak is delivered with the testimonial panache of men with nothing to lose. 

Holiday&#39;s intense riffing has shot Rival Sons to the foreground of contemporary rock music. Just take a quick listen to the aforementioned songs. Whoever&#39;s lips don&#39;t tremble with the desire to hum those cool riffs? 

It comes as no surprise that Holiday knows his rock curriculum by heart. He learned to rock out from an early age with an upbringing soaked in the fine vintage of rock n roll. 

His first idols were whomever his family listened to: i.e. The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Rush, Cream, Jeff Beck as well as soul, blues, and a bit of garage rock. 

For a player guided by his ears these sounds seeped into his DNA, making it possible for him to fuse all of his inspirations from the Golden Years of Rock into the thunderous rock sound of today.

At age 11 he got his first guitar; an acoustic Spanish guitar on which he played jingles and riffs from the B52&#39;s, ZZ Top and Van Halen. 

But the nylon strings lacked the primal power of electrified rock music, and so only a year later he switched to an electric guitar and has never looked back since. 

Holiday is very much the dedicated musician. In a world where many are called but only few chosen, he has paved his own way, honing his craft every step of the way on the journey from a young man with ambition to a seasoned player burning with passion.

From playing in early bands that got signed but not released to that fateful moment when he accidentally stumbled upon lead singer Jay Buchanan on MySpace and found the songwriting partner of a lifetime, he has stuck to his guitar and relied on those six strings to churn out the prodigious notes that now sees him travelling the globe and playing the biggest stages in the world.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[With both an Emmy and a Golden Reel award on his shelf, James Mather is one of the top supervising sound editors in the film industry and has proven time and again, that he is a true master of turning fantasy into sound and silence.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[More than 20 years into his career, James Mather is working as supervising sound editor, re-recordist and sound designer out of the UK post-production hub in London&#39;s Soho district.

His ability to collaborate with the filmmakers and create consistent sound profiles across movies has seen him put audio to blockbusters as well as stop-motion feature films and classic drama.

&#39;Sound is the last stage of the film making process, so it has an awful lot of responsibility to all the people who have created it thus far,&#39; he tells us as we meet up with him for a chat in the West End of London.

&#39;It is all about translating the director&#39;s vision and needs to tell the story. Everything we do is deliberate - and there isn&#39;t a sound in there that hasn&#39;t been considered and exists there for a good reason.&#39;

As he and his team explore the footage, they come up with a vast catalogue of ideas for sound design and occasionally end up re-recording the effects side of the sound track - both on location and via foley recordings - to piece it all together in the editing room.

The impressive and diverse list of movies to Mather&#39;s credit include Sherlock Holmes, the Philip Glass-scored Notes on a Scandal, a dozen episodes of Creature Comforts and no less than four installments of the Harry Potter series.

All of these demand great attention to detail in the use of both sound - and silence. Same goes for his perhaps most unique work as a sound editor: Nick Park&#39;s two stop-motion masterpieces, Chicken Run and the Oscar-winning Wallace &amp; Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.

Here Mather dives deep into the immersive qualities of a good soundscape and helps bring life to the plasticine puppets, that has captivated moviegoers of all ages and kept them on the edge of their seats.

Recently he has been working on numerous feature films - all of them too top secret for us to mention here.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Working in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex&#39;s gospel and R&amp;B scene led Lettieri to join jazz/world group Snarky Puppy in 2008. The now three-time GRAMMY Award-winning band tours and records constantly, having performed on all continents except Antarctica.

Aside from Snarky Puppy, Lettieri has spent time on the road with neo-soul icon Erykah Badu, gospel singer/actress Tamela Mann, and American Idol: Season 11 winner Phillip Phillips. He&#39;s also performed with a myriad of other artists, including Anthony Evans, Chrisette Michele, Myron Butler, N&#39;dambi, Bilal, and even Pat Boone.

Since 2010, he has been a member of the house band for the Marcus &amp; Joni Show, a morning talk/variety show broadcast in 200 countries on Daystar, a Christian cable network.

As a composer/bandleader, Lettieri has released three albums, Knows in 2011, and Futurefun in 2013, and most recently, Spark and Echo in 2016 (Ropeadope Records). Through tours with Snarky Puppy and social media network shares, these records have created a sizable buzz among fans of instrumental guitar music worldwide.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[One half of remix super-duo Bimbo Jones, Marc JB has tapped the tempo for countless nights out. Rooted in equal amounts of funky bits, sway and precision technique, the lime-lit duo has produced no less than 70 No. 1 singles in the UK and US.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Initially a skilled pianist with 10 years of jazz clubbing to his name, Marc JB&#39;s entry into the remix sphere wasn&#39;t exactly written in the stars. His shift towards dance music came after joining forces with hard-hitting DJ Lee Dagger, forming the now legendary Bimbo Jones tag-team.

Early on they established themselves with a consistent output, along the way remixing top-flight vocalists such as Lady Gaga, Annie Lennox and Rihanna and bringing the boogie to artists like The Killers and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.

As the Londoners were about to witness, Bimbo Jones were on a mission to pack the dance floors. Quickly finding a working setup utilizing Lee&#39;s DJ-duties, they&#39;d make a track during the day and then test it out at the club at night - with Lee on the decks and Marc sitting on the sub bass speaker, quietly taking note of how the sound worked and scoping the audience&#39;s reaction.

Having the ears and feet of three or four thousand clubbers as a litmus test of their tracks provided the duo with valuable and always honest feedback, resulting in an extremely efficient workflow. At the height of their remixing run, they were literally churning out remixes, doing maybe four or five - a week.

Based on this high-caliber, rapid-fire output, they were duly nominated world&#39;s best remixers six years in a row at the International Dance Music Awards.

One of the thumbprints of the Bimbo Jones discography is their strong hi-hat control. This lends their mixes an immense energy and adds that clear sense of pace and urgency, that hallmarks the British post-millennial electronic scene.

From his Velvet Jam studio - recently built, complete with an exceptionally tight control room and a live drum/ performance room and all - JB is currently producing for bands, film and TV as well as remixing.

In his own words: &#39;It&#39;s all about vibes and creativity unleashed from here on in!&#39;]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[There are about 50 ways to say &#39;awesome&#39;, and they all rhyme with Ben Verse.

With sixty-odd dubstep and drum &amp; bass releases to his name, he has been pushing out a steady flow of airtight, NASA-grade productions and has over the last couple of years emerged as one of a new wave of select producers to really watch out for.

In addition to music issued on his own Crunch Recordings imprint which he launched back in 2004, Ben has releases on Renegade Hardware, Vision, Architecture and N-Type&#39;s legendary Wheel &amp; Deal Records - to name but a few.

One of the solid signatures of his 16 years of producing is the clean, deep and organic tone that connects all the elements of his mixes, whether they&#39;re stomping around the bass heavy neighbourhoods or veering into lighter, more rattling territories.

Solo projects aside, Ben has enjoyed massive success as the MC for platinum-selling band Pendulum, whose 2010 album Immersion immediately claimed the no. 1 spot in the UK, propelling the drum &amp; bass genre back into public awareness.

Currently based out of London, Ben can be found performing all over the world as a DJ and rapper - both with and without Pendulum - as well as developing upcoming artists based in his Black Swan Studios.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Rudy Sarzo is nothing less than a legend on the bass guitar. His more than 35 years in music includes membership of awesome bands like Ozzy Osbourne, Quiet Riot, White Snake, DIO, Blue &#214;yster Cult and many others.  He has played on a number of records that have sold in excess of 30 million copies.

Not only is the tireless Sarzo a master on the bass, he is also the author of the bestselling book, &quot;Off the Rails&quot; - a biographical account of his time in Ozzy Osbourne&#39;s band in the early 1980s. 

Moreover, he is a competent computer digital animator and operates as the 3D technical director and co-executive producer at Ocean Visual FX in Southern California when he is not on the road. 

And, if it wasn&#39;t enough already, Sarzo also devotes time to helping find homes for homeless shelter animals, and acting as a counselor at Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp.

The Cuban born Sarzo came to the United States with his parents and his brother in 1961 - back then he was 11 years old. The family first came to Miami, but was relocated to New Jersey. 

This was a real cultural shock, not only because of the language barrier, but because of the weather conditions too. The much colder climate was tough to adjust to for the family from the sub-tropical Caribbean island.  

Though rocking the bass for several decades, Rudy Sarzo didn&#39;t actually start out playing bass. Instead he had an old craftsman acoustic guitar. 

Sarzo wanted to join the local band in his neighborhood, but they already had enough guitarists. So, he was told, that if he wanted to be a part of the band, he had to play bass. Since then, the bass guitar has been his life companion. 

Rudy Sarzo joined Quiet Riot in the summer of 1978 and stayed in the band until it broke up in late 1979 when Randy Rhoads left to join Ozzy Osborne.

From March that year to September &#39;82, he really rose to fame as the bassist in Ozzy Osbourne&#39;s band, which he toured the world with in support of the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; and &#39;Diary Of a Madman&#39; records. 

His blazing playing can be heard on Osbourne&#39;s &#39;Speak of the Devil&#39; and &quot;Tribute&quot; live albums.    

From &#39;82 to &#39;85 Sarzo rejoined Quiet Riot, with whom he recorded the multi-platinum albums &#39;Metal Health&#39;, and &#39;Condition Critical&#39;. &#39;Metal Health&#39; is the first Heavy Metal debut to reach #1 on the Billboard charts.

A quality-conscious man, Rudy Sarzo continued his career with Whitesnake from &#39;87 to &#39;94. With the band he recorded the multi-platinum album &#39;Slip of the Tongue&#39;. 

From &#39;97 to &#39;03 he was a member of the reunited Quiet Riot, and, in &#39;04, Sarzo became a member of the multi-platinum Heavy Metal group DIO. 

He remained the band&#39;s bassist until 2010. Meanwhile, and until 2012, he also toured the world with Blue &#214;yster Cult.

Besides all of these great bands, the legendary and assiduous Rudy Sarzo has played with Angel, Yngwie Malmsteen&#39;s Rising Force, Geoff Tate&#39;s Queensryche, The Guess Who, D-Metal, Animetal USA, Project Rock, GUNZO, Devil City Angels, Heart of the Storm as well as recorded as a solo artist.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[As one of Denmark&#39;s most popular touring guitarists and the live guitarist for acclaimed art rockers Mew, Mads Wegner have worked his thick guitar sound into the ears of concert-goers for two decades.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[A lust for gritty, edgy, thick sound effects, that make the audience cheer their hearts and lungs out - that&#39;s what you get out of being a touring guitarist.

As a teenager growing his stubs, Mads listened his way into the formative years through Jimmy Hendrix and Eric Clapton. The world&#39;s first super group and power trio Cream also got hold of his attention, inspiring him to dig in to the groove and twelve-bar chord progressions of the blues.

As a live guitarist he has shared the stage with such diverse acts as famous Danish singers Anne Linnet and Anne Dorte Michelsen, renowned guitarist Billy Cross, singer-songwriter Tue West, Danish rock band The Storm fronted by singer Pernille Rosendahl and as of late rock outfit Mew.

In 2015 Mads teamed up with Mew, a full 18 years after he attended his first concert with the band: &#39;I felt like a child being adopted into somebody else&#39;s family. And at our first rehearsal, I really felt like it was my first day in a new school.&#39; 

Mads was brought in as a replacement for the guitarist and founding member of Mew. Filling in for another magnificent guitarist is never easy, but Mads has managed to claim his own chair, and carved his name solidly into the back of it. 

He always brings all his own amps and effects, and on stage he tries to give the band a thicker sound - topped off with some weird modulation. Especially in the fingerpicking parts and intros, here the guitar stands alone, so Mads wants it to fill the whole canvas.

For the sweet, ear-filling art rock, he uses the classic slap delay. So immensely popular within the indie scene, that is almost serves as a trademark for the entire genre, yet aeons before the indie scene claimed it, however, it was a characteristic of rockabilly and related styles, think Bill Haley, Elvis Presley and anything Sam Phillips ever touched.

As a touring sidearm the slapback have been, is, always will be the first and biggest love on Mads&#39; pedal board.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Knowing when to go full throttle and when to hold back a bit on your instrument is essential to any musician. As the highly regarded bass player for Danish art rock band Mew, Johan Wohlert has perfected the classic rock n roll craft of timing and modesty.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Johan first heard this sound in his idols, such as a Kim Deal from the Pixies and U2&#39;s Adam Clayton. Just like Johan these titans of rock tie a beautiful knot between vocals and instruments and help release the full emotional potential of the song.

The comforting bass tone Johan strives for and brings to Mew, is a pretty simple one. Binding the band&#39;s sound together with a melodic foundation and symmetry, it brings out the both fragile and grandiose sound, that intrigues their fans, and makes Mew so special. 

A vital part of this identity stems from Johan&#39;s commanding fingers. He hits the strings pretty hard, so in the studio he uses a compressor to keep the sound on a leash, leaving a smooth, fat and balanced tone.

Seeking new adventures and experiences, Johan left Mew in 2006 and started The Storm with his then-sweetheart Pernille Rosendahl of Swan Lee fame. With this new setup he fused a heavier bass tone with the traditions of symphonic rock, leaving plenty of space for Rosendahl, the female vocalist.

After three albums and seven years sharing band name, Pernille and Johan however realised that sometimes life isn&#39;t easy when you are both living and working together, and decided to go their separate ways.

And then Mew resurfaced as the NorthSide Festival 2014. Smiles as broad as bridges, the crowd going mental, and the pure delight and happiness of half a generation who witnessed their idols together for the first time in eight years. That was the sight Johan created, when he returned to the stage as part of Mew. It was a major triumph for the band - and the guy.

The reviewers, too, went nuts, as the resurrected band delivered the soundtrack to half a generation&#39;s first romantic escapades and was hailed by critics for their original sound.

Recently the band has been recording news songs for their upcoming album as well as working with the Copenhagen Phil, one of the oldest professional symphony orchestras in the world, re-arranging classic Mew songs.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[From child prodigy to YouTube sensation, Chelsea Constable knows her way around the fretboard better than most seasoned guitarists. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Chelsea Constable was born to master the guitar. She first felt the itch to pick up the instrument, when she was but 10-years old and wanted to learn the traditional &#39;Greensleeves&#39; for a church Christmas play. She was quickly considered a prodigy. 

From then on she developed a passionate interest in instrumental guitar music and soon discovered advanced players like Steve Morse, Paul Gilbert, and Andy Timmons, soaking up their dexterous and accomplished techniques to form her own unique expression. 

Early on her abilities were recognized by the guitar community and she started demoing products for various companies and being featured and advertised in several of the major guitar publications. 

While being filmed for a prodigy show by VH1/Camera Planet in 2003, the 13-year-old Chelsea had the honor of closing the show at Muriel Anderson&#39;s All Star Guitar Night featuring among others Steve Morse (Deep Purple) and none other than the legendary inventor and guitarist, Mr. Les Paul. 

As the opportunity presented itself, Chelsea got the chance for a historic meeting with the late legend. She describes it as a &#39;life-changing conversation&#39;.

Chelsea Constable is known nowadays among YouTubers for her thorough instructional series called &#39;The Solo Lesson Series&#39;. Here she takes on the very best and most loved guitar solos in the world, performing them with breathtaking attention to detail and stirring feel, before breaking them down into easier bits, so that the aspiring guitarist starting out can get the notes of his heroes under his fingers.

Besides working on her own solo material and on her own studio for in-house session work, recording, and video instruction, Chelsea Constable also has an impressive resume with some of the world&#39;s most renowned guitar players, having played with the likes of Paul Gilbert, Steve Vai, Billy Sheehan, Gregg Bissonette, Dave LaRue, Steve Morse, Tommy Emmanuel, Doyle Dykes and Travis Carlton (Larry Carlton&#39;s son), just to mention a few. 

As an always searching player, she doesn&#39;t confine to one style instead she loves all genres. &#39;You can&#39;t really put my music in a genre, because I love all styles and incorporate them into my playing.&#39; 

She keeps evolving as a musician by focusing on the problem areas of her playing and taking lessons from other players that don&#39;t play guitar such as horn and piano players. &#39;It&#39;s great to see how they interpret riffs and solos.&#39;

As a guitar player she is also contemplative about the subject of &#39;great tone&#39;. 

&#39;Tone can be interpreted many ways with many outcomes on any given day, maybe even the mood you are in and how aggressively or soft you play. Whether you are playing one note or many. Sometimes a single vibrato can say many things, when you have the warmth of a really awesome sounding rig,&#39; she muses.

To achieve her tone, she runs her main guitar, a Suhr Classic Pro H/S/S pickup configuration, into a Hedgehog 50 and 2x12 cab loaded with Celestion Heritage Series G12-65&#39;s. Her rig consists of only TC Electronic stompboxes. She uses the PolyTune 2 (mini), Hypergravity Compressor and Dark Matter Distortion straight through the amp head.

Through the effects loop, she has a Helix Phaser, Hall of Fame Reverb and Alter Ego Echo attatched to a Holeyboard Standard M3 pedalboard by Chemistry Design Werks with Walrus Audio Aetos 120V Clean Power Supply.  

&#39;It makes me feel more confident and at ease when I am playing live to know that I can achieve the tone I want,&#39; she tells. 

Chelsea&#39;s upcoming debut CD will feature several guitar greats such as Paul Gilbert, Steve Morse and Doyle Dykes.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Known for his superb online lessons - and a black silk glove - Scott Devine uses his masterful chops to guide bassists of all levels to achieve their musical goals and become better musicians. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[The story of Scott Devine is one of adapting to every circumstance and tackle all hindrances, of overcoming the unexpected twists and turns of life, to stay close to the core of music itself. 

In many ways Scott Devine was an unlikely candidate to pick up and master the bass. A childhood friend convinced him to join guitar practice with some other kids at shcool. They soon lost interest, which meant the end for the guitar class. But Devine stuck to the instrument and was instead tutored by a work friend of his father for a pack of cigarettes a lesson. 

The work friend saw talent glimmering in his young pupil and advised Devine&#39;s father to let the kid take classical guitar lessons. 

The young Devine made his way to classical guitar competitions and got his first taste of reading music. He has explained in interviews how this formative experience pushed him and shaped his approach to grasping music.

As a teenager Devine hung around the wrong crowd and fell back in school, but found a way out trouble, when he saw an advertisement in the paper for an apprentice luthier in Chris May&#39;s newly upstarted company Overwater basses in Carlisle. 

Here he became fascinated by the rumbling instrument and decided to learn how to play it. As luck would have it, a bass luthier&#39;s company was the right place to discover such a passion, and he was able to borrow an instrument with him home.

It was also here opportunity presented itself, when a bass player, stricken with health issues, one day called to look for a replacement. Scott was given the chance to fill in the pit of a musical. 

He ended up staying for a year, opting to leave his apprenticeship and instead learn to read bass clef and achieving a fuller understanding of music. It was the first steps on the path to an active playing career. 

From here on no gig was too small for Devine, who travelled all over the world, learning the trades of a professional working musician the hard way on cruise ships, shows and musicals, and later stumbling into a position as musical director for Sony in Poland. 

Along the way he soaked up boundless experience from life on the road, getting a thorough know-how of all the facets of bass playing, meeting up with great musicians, and receiving endless inspiration from band members.

For years on end Devine gigged five to six nights a week, keeping himself busy in his off-time by practicing even more. It seemed that he would never put down his bass.

But then disaster struck. Over a period of three years he started to lose control of his fingers, not only when playing bass, but also while typing on a computer. He was diagnosed with a neurological condition, Focal Dystonia, and told that he could not play anymore. 

This is undoubtingly heartbreaking news for any musician, and Scott Devine didn&#39;t touch a bass for six months. The insecurity of not being able to continue his known life left his mind in turmoil.

He briefly considered returning to being a luthier and he even enrolled in a classical guitar making course, while seeking treatment for his condition. It was a world spanning search for a cure to an ailment that had neither the clarity of an explanation or the hope of recovery. 

A doctor mentioned that a famous violinist with the same issue had found that wearing latex gloves helped. It may sound preposterous, but Devine had run out of prescribed options and was willing to take a chance on anything that could help just the slightest. 

This marks the point in time when Devine ordered his first black silk gloves and found that he could start playing again little by little. From being told he would never be able to play the bass again, this was a genuine breakthrough - no matter how random.

While the bass had rested on its stand, he had spent his downtime watching and scrutinizing online bass lessons - though he admits it sometimes felt like torture, when he wasn&#39;t able to pick up the bass himself - and realized that while the lessons showcased high technical ability, they weren&#39;t useful in securing a gig as a working musician. 

Inspired by this and with the desire to create lessons aimed more at improving overall playing rather than just learning licks, he started uploading his own lessons.  

The immediate feedback was good, people taking notice of the unconventional glove, and prompted the demand for even more lessons, and suddenly Devine found himself learning how to manage an online business. 

Scott&#39;s Bass Lessons now boasts not only online lessons, but also an academy with courses and live seminars. His lessons are followed by bass players in the thousands across the globe. And with good reason.

As a bass player Devine exhibits a rare combination of traits. He has a great sense of rhythm, harmony and melody and he plays in the pocket. 

But he also has the gift of being a great educator, understanding how to get someone to succeed in something, they might not think they would be able to do.   

This journeyman now takes all the knowledge he has accumulated over an illustrious career and dispenses it with great care to the future bass players of the world.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[You&#39;ve probably encountered the cool groove of Winston Blissett on your radio at some point in time. He has a formidable resume of who&#39;s who in pop music. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[However, pop is not all this stylish player is about. Fans of trip hop legends Massive Attack may be even more familiar with this rock solid bass player, seeing as he&#39;s the foundation of the Bristol band&#39;s prodigious sound both on album and live.

But before Blissett even got into the world of pop and atmospheric soundscaping, he played gospel music at New Testament Church, sharing a similar background with other great players whose groove have been shaped by the sanctity of the church room.  

His first break as a professional musician came with the band Headline. They signed to Virgin Records, but only lasted a year. Blissett then formed Bumble &amp; The Beez with Mykaell Riley and won a contract with EMI Records in 1981.

However, it was first a couple of years later his work as a studio and touring musician kicked off. Working hard and professionally to make a name for himself, his next big break came along in 1990, touring with English singer Lisa Stanfield&#39;s band. 

Since that time, Winston has worked with many of the world&#39;s leading pop, jazz, R&amp;b, gospel &amp; blues bands and artist. Notably recording and touring with Massive Attack - just check out the opening track &#39;Angel&#39; of their 1998-album &#39;Mezzanine&#39; for Blissett&#39;s brooding bass line - Boy George and Tom Robinson.

He has also recorded with big mainstream names as English singer-songwriter James Morrison, Take That-bad boy Robbie Williams, Aussie pop-princess Kylie Minogue, legendary Cher, the smooth singer Lionel Richie, Genesis frontman and drummer Phil Collins, ravers Basement Jaxx, Mattafix, China Black, Denis Bovell, and teen pop group S Club 7.

It&#39;s not only in the studio Blissett excels. He has also toured and shared the stage with Robert Palmer, Hamish Stewart, Jimmy Cliff, Jeff Lorber, and Swing Out Sister, adding some extra soul to their hot vibes.

Blissett spends his time in between recording sessions and touring, gigging with sax player Derek Nash&#39;s funk group Protect the beat and also plays at functions and local venues.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Federico Malaman is revitalizing jazz fusion for the modern audience, while exuding an exuberant joy of playing. If you want to be mesmerized by remarkable chops, look no further.  

]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[The funky Italian bass player is no less than an Internet sensation, with over a million YouTube-views on some of his videos performing instantly danceable grooves, making him popular far beyond the circles of jazz enthusiasts. 

The incredibly talented and knowledgeable bass player always displays great musicianship and a stunning technical ability that is almost unmatched. 

But one does not simply become one of the most watched jazz fusion innovators on YouTube and social media overnight. 

Malamam has paid his dues as an arranger of major Italian television shows, one of all, the Italian edition of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with Paolo Belli&#39;s Big Band. 

In the course of his career collaborated with internationally renowned artists such as George Benson, Solomon Burke, Wilson Pickett, Al Jarreau and Kid Creole.

The 37-year-old Malaman first picked up the bass at the age of 12, inspired by the playing of Polo Jones on the hit record &#39;Oro, Incenso e Birra&#39; by beloved Italian artist Zucchero Sugar Fornacciari. The solid and expressive style made the first lasting impression on the young musician to be.

&#39;The bass lines on those songs are awesome,&#39; he tells. &#39;Polo Jones plays on that very album and it started everything.&#39;

One prominent feature of Malaman&#39;s YouTube videos is his use of a looper. He often creates his own colorful loops to groove and shred on.  Not surprisingly a looper is also the type of effect he would choose, if he stranded on a desert island.

&#39;I improve my playing, because it&#39;s like playing with somebody. That also means I would feel less alone. And then of course it runs on a battery. I don&#39;t imagine there&#39;s any electricity on a desert island,&#39; he says with a sly smile.

Also he notes that to evolve as a musician one should listen to all kinds of musicians and try to keep their best parts, utilizing their strengths in one&#39;s own playing. 

This approach has led to one of the most technical yet highly musical bass players in the world. Malaman can easily play sophisticated parts with fleet fingers, but also hit a groove so heavy it takes over your body.

However, having chops for ages doesn&#39;t mean that one should be playing all notes possible at all times. For Malaman tone is connected to what to play and when. 

&#39;A great tone is when you&#39;ve got the right tone for the song you&#39;re playing,&#39; he explains.

Still as an artist - and namely a master of fusion jazz - Malaman is always reinterpreting the songs he plays to find a new way to unlock their secrets. 

He discovers new paths by tweaking his effects: &#39;When I have a &#39;different&#39; sound that I love, I&#39;m enticed to play in a different way. That&#39;s great, if you want to be a little bit different every time.&#39;

In addition to running his own solo career, Malaman also tours with Mario Biondi, one of the most popular singers Soul &amp; Jazz, both in Italy and abroad (UK, Germany, France, Japan, Russia and other countries). 

He currently uses Mayones and Laurus electric basses, an acoustic bass by Manne, Eich amps, LQS strings and a range of TC effects.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[The ferocious days of the 80&#39;s hairspray kings on Sunset Strip may be long gone, but audiences worldwide still crave good lookin&#39; dudes with pouty lips, eyeliner and voluminous hair the length of a model&#39;s legs playing glamorous sounding rock anthems.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Just ask Satchel, the six-string hero of glam rock sensation Steel Panther.

Every time Satchel hits the stage, he transforms his surroundings and takes his audience back to a time, where music was just more carefree and fun. 

He cranks his amp to eleven and beyond, tearing out the volume knob and drowns it in a lukewarm bottle of booze, because you know that&#39;s how rock&#39;n&#39;roll was made to be. Loud and action packed!

You shouldn&#39;t turn away, shaking your head in disbelief, due to the clear elements of comedy and sarcasm that makes this colorful gang of renegades stand out. Behind the jokes and the parody-attitude lays an undeniable musicality that draws from all the greats. 

With clear inspiration from heavy guitar virtuosos Ritchie Blackmore (Deep Purple) and Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath), Satchel easily muscles the gut punching riff, and similar to the iconic guitar hero Van Halen, he deftly creates guitar-rhythm parts that stick in your head.

Whether you describe Steel Panther as heavy metal&#39;s comic afterbirth, a foul-mouthed Kiss or plainly macho heavy rockers with pink lipstick, Satchel&#39;s ear twisting musical skills and catchy riffs are no joke. Playing classic chord progressions, he ups the ante by adding accents and making them his own. 

The sound may be based on a more than 30-year-old hair metal tradition, but the riffs sound fresh and vibrant. It almost compels you to throw on a pair of leather pants, fix up your hair high with hairspray, and stroll down the street, wearing sunglasses in cloudy weather, sipping a Jack Daniels on a weekday. Rock, man!

Satchel&#39;s gift for riffing and speedy leads, combined with his bawdy humor (it&#39;s like watching a standup-comedian on an over-the-top, unstoppable, embarrassingly long rant about sex, intercourse and in-action-condom-testing), has made him a massive hit online. 

He also generously passes on his guitar knowledge to a large audience of viewers. Look him up on YouTube, between the locker-room rants of boobs and pick-ups (not those on your guitar!), there is a vast amount of tips and how-to tricks, all keynotes to mastering the guitar.

Satchel is currently on tour in America until January 2017. Steel Panther release their new album &#39;Lower the Bar&#39; the 24th of February 2017. 

If your party needs to get rowdy, Satchel&#39;s fierce Steel Panther licks are the way to go!

					<artistBio><![CDATA[With a Grammy Award on his shelf and a solid client index listing top artists such as Santigold, Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift, recording engineer Brendan Morawski is at the top of his game.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Brendan Morawski ending up in the music business is no coincidence. His father is a professional musician, and therefore young Brendan grew up surrounded by music. However, Morawski didn&#39;t discover that recording music was even a profession until he was around 10 years old.

&#39;I had an old CD, and a new CD of the same album, and I remember the new CD sounding incredibly better,&#39; Morawski explains.

The new CD was digitally re-mastered, and it dawned on him that someone &#39;must have done something to the recordings, that already existed, to make them sound better. And, that&#39;s what let me unto the path of understanding that recording music was a profession.&#39;

In 2010, Morawski graduated from Full Sail&#39;s Recording Arts bachelor&#39;s degree program and, in 2013, he landed a job as Assistant Engineer at Jungle City Studios, in New York.

At Jungle City Studios, he one day met Jack Antonoff. One afternoon in the studio, working on some new music for one of Antonoff&#39;s friends, Taylor Swift, the two recorded &#39;Out of the Woods&#39; and &#39;I Wish You Would&#39;. Both tracks ended up on Swift&#39;s album, 1989, which brought home a Grammy Award for Album Of The year.

Though earning his own Grammy for his work for Taylor Swift, the most rewarding mix Morawski has done is &#39;Before the Fire&#39; for Santigold. Although he has worked with some of the best mastering engineers in the world, he thinks that Santigold is one of the most sonically demanding artists he has worked for - also, she has the best hearing out of anyone he has ever met. So, &#39;To be able to do a mix that not only satisfies her needs, but makes me feel proud of the sounds that I got are very refreshing,&#39; he explains.

Working in the music business, Morawski needs to be willing to adapt. Therefore, he&#39;s been a huge &#39;in the box&#39; guy for a long time, &#39;cause working in only one software program - for him Pro Tools - makes it easier to transition from one engineer, or one studio, to the next.

&#39;It&#39;s very common for me to track a studio in one state, mix it in another state, do some overdubs in another state, so depending highly on analog gear has proven to be very challenging in the past&#39;, he says. Recently, he has started to get himself &#39;out of the box&#39;, though. Now he is beginning to work in his hybrid setup with a little bit of analog summing, analog compression and analog effects.

In his daily work, Morawski, first and foremost depends on Pro Tools, to make his life simpler and to be able to attend to his artists&#39; needs. But, also the TELEFUNKEN microphones is something that he depends on every day in order to get an incredible sounding recording, and to realize what the artist&#39;s intentions were.

However, one of his favorite pieces of gear is the System 6000: &#39;It&#39;s one of the only pieces of gear I&#39;ve used that I found to be capable of making changes without compromise. The algorithms on it are just so incredible, and there are so much detail with the settings that you have, that you can really dial in exactly what you&#39;re looking for without having to deal with any side effects,&#39; he explains.]]></artistBio2>

Rocky has worked on both platinum award-winning and many Grammy-nominated projects. He has collaborated with genre defining artists like John Legend, Tycho, Norah Jones, Neon Indian, Cat Power, Ice Cube - and a bunch of others.

Moreover, he has worked closely with notorious producers, such as Steve Lillywhite, Eddie Kramer, Will.I.AM, Track Masters, and not least the legendary Jimmy Douglass. 

As a kid, Rocky started recording at a friend&#39;s house: &#39;A friend&#39;s father had an old TEAC reel-to-reel recorder in the basement and that was the place we always hung out in, so we would just start making our own recordings,&#39; he explains.

Hence, Rocky found himself having a studio that just got bigger and bigger. And bigger - in his friend&#39;s basement. He ended up moving to his current base in New York where he, in his own words, &#39;just have more toys&#39;.   

But, nothing comes without hard work, and Anthony &#39;Rocky&#39; Gallo is a dedicated and detail oriented person, who constantly brings the projects that he&#39;s working on home to make sure that it is as good as he want it to be. He thinks it is important never to feel too comfortable, but keep pushing yourself, and keep trying new things all the time.

His sessions vary a lot. Sometimes, people hire him just for the beginning, or the end of a session, or just for the overdub, or in the middle of making a record. So, it&#39;s always changing, which is ideal for him. &#39;I don&#39;t necessarily want to just track drums for rock bands all the time - I love doing it, I just like when things get changed up a little bit,&#39; he explains. 

The most rewarding to Rocky is when he gets to see a project through from the beginning to the end. Therefore, he feels right at home when he gets to work on various things, and with different genres, and different tracking. This is also evident in the various projects and artists he has recorded, mixed, mastered, and produced with, which span everything from alternative rock to r&amp;b, and hip hop. 

Anthony &#39;Rocky&#39; Gallo is constantly producing artists, and currently, he has a lot of stuff going on that he&#39;s really happy about. One band he&#39;s been working for recently is Cigarettes After Sex, which is very shoegazey, beautiful, and has tons of reverb at the core of their sound.

&#39;We recorded it in a movie theater stairwell. Very minimal, but it&#39;s all about huge reverb and tons of space,&#39; the creative producer and recording engineer explains.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Brazilian guitar prodigy and social media shooting star, Mateus Asato, is making his presence felt with his tasteful, melodic playing and annoyingly good technique, mastering everything from bluesy soul and jazzy ballads to shredding metal.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Based in Hollywood and rooted in Brazil, Mateus Asato has become a household name in the world of social media guitar wizardry. Born in 1993, Asato picked up the guitar as a nine year old kid and received only two years of private lessons before he began playing with the local church&#39;s worship team. 
As a teenager, he bested 500 other guitar players in the Brazilian guitar contest &#39;Double Vision&#39;, an experience that inspired him to pursue guitar playing professionally. 
Three years later, he moved to Los Angeles to study music at Musician&#39;s Institute where he graduated with the title of &#39;2014 Outstanding Guitar Player of Musician&#39;s Institute&#39;.

Mateus Asato&#39;s playing is instantly recognizable; melodic chord progressions interwoven with flurries of tasty single note lines, seamlessly switching between his pick and his fingers. His playing grew from a wide range of musical influences. 
At first, he idolized the likes of shred gods Steve Vai and John Petrucci but after being introduced to the guitar-centric pop-rock of John Mayer, he went in a different direction. This led him on to the bluesy playing of icons like Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan but also to the ethereal fingerstyle playing of Andy McKee and the indie-folk of Bon Iver. 

According to himself, Asato&#39;s style arose from attempting to play like his heroes and finding his own ways of going about the stuff that he couldn&#39;t play. This pragmatic approach to the guitar has resulted in a uniquely eclectic style that displays a soulful touch, animated with passion and tempered by a keen sense of lyricism. But don&#39;t just take our word for it, look him up online if you haven&#39;t already! 
On his profiles, you can see Asato performing his own compositions and showcasing his mastery of technical ability, tone and taste. Asato&#39;s video demonstrations on social media are as popular as they are impressive, many of them soaring through the YouTube stratosphere with over 100k views. 

These days, Asato is travelling the world giving clinics to budding guitarists while regularly uploading demonstrations of his prowess on his social media feed. Aside from being part of American singer-songwriter Tory Kelly&#39;s touring band since 2015, Asato has played with acts such as Mammoth, Israel Houghton, Esteban, and Jabin Chavez. He is hoping to record his own music before long, and frankly - we can&#39;t wait for it to happen!

					<artistBio><![CDATA[As an original member of Bay Area thrashers, Testament, whilst also leading the line for his own namesake jazz trio, Alex Skolnick can do it all.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Joining Bay Area metal band Testament at just age sixteen, and with such renowned contemporaries as Slayer and Megadeth, Alex was forced to grow up quickly.

Under the tutelage of Joe Satriani, who helped sow the seeds for so many budding young guitarists of that scene (Kirk Hammett, among them), Alex went on to enjoy considerable success with Testament and cement his place in heavy metal history.

Fast forward 30-something years and Alex is still considered a pioneer of the now classic 1980&#39;s thrash metal genre of which he had a hand in popularizing.

Not content with resting on his blackened, heavy metal laurels, Alex has since 1998 made a foray into the world of jazz. Seeking to expand his horizons, Alex moved to New York to devote himself to the craft, emerging in 2002 with his own jazz outfit, Alex Skolnick Trio. Since then, Alex&#39;s reputation as a jazz guitarist has gone from strength to strength, earning him a whole roster of new peers, as well as plaudits from some of the genres most well-respected journalists, not to mention an abundance of new fans and followers.

Not letting himself be entirely distracted by his new surroundings, Alex still busies himself with the harder styles of his earlier days, being a writer, producer and performer for hard-hitting super-group Metal Allegiance, which formed in 2014. 

Seamlessly jumping from metal to jazz and back again, Alex&#39;s willingness to take on the mantle of musical chameleon has seen him earn as reputation as one of the most well-versed guitar players in the world. No matter which stage he graces, Alex&#39;s melodic, intense and precise playing style leaves audiences the world over amazed and wanting more.

Never looking backwards and ever striving to break new ground, Alex Skolnick as a musician is the epitome of versatility. Whether it be the heavy metal trappings of Testament or bebop interpretations of hard rock classics, Skolnick takes it all in his stride. A true virtuoso of the instrument.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[As a Los Angeles native, veteran scoring engineer Jason LaRocca has always been close to Hollywood. Coming out of rock music his powerful mixes have seen him put the sonic glue in both theatrical feature films, tv series, and immersive games.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[There&#39;s obviously a long way from a four-track cassette machine to the giant consoles of Hollywood. But like so many others, Jason LaRocca&#39;s first foray into mixing and producing started out with a rock&#39;n&#39;roll band and a TASCAM Porta.

At the age of 18, Jason had already become a fully fledged producer and recording engineer.

His always original, often genius approach to recording has led him to collaborations with notable composers such as Nick Urata, Emmy-winning Mark Isham, Craig Armstrong, and strings connoisseur David Campbell.

Working mostly in the box with the occasional hardware reverb on the side, Jason has worked on such diverse projects as The Accountant, A Series of Unfortunate Events for Netflix, and the intimate soundtrack for American Crime for ABC.

Not to mention the amazing CGI-live-action flick Paddington, based on the adventures of the 1950&#39;s teddy bear character by the same name.

Jason&#39;s steady hand and ear seamlessly interweave electronic, rock and classical elements with a rare confidence, and animated by his moonlighting in the acclaimed punk rock four-piece The Briggs, he always brings that special something to his score mixes.

One of the things that set Jason&#39;s work apart from many others, is his bold use of philharmonic recordings. Always appreciating the key character and tone traditions of the individual instruments, he feeds these the energy, potency and sometimes ferociousness of rock&#39;n&#39;roll, taking them to new and unexpected levels of expression.

Because, really, a little bit of punk rock never hurt anyone!]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Sweden has a knack for producing fantastic rock guitar players, solidifying that tendency with Opeth&#39;s Fredrik &#197;kesson who is surely among the finest shredders to ever emerge from Scandinavia.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Hailing from Stockholm, Sweden, Fredrik &#197;kesson is the virtuosic shredder behind Opeth&#39;s signature brand of Swedish heavy metal. While &#197;kesson is primarily known for playing guitar in Opeth, he is also active in the bands Krux, Monsters of Metal, and Talisman.

Born in 1972, &#197;kesson picked up the guitar at the tender age of 10 and before long, he was playing eight hours a day, heavily influenced by shred gods like Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth, Gary Moore, Frank Marino, Shawn Lane, George Lynch, and Yngwie Malmsteen.
 
In 1992, he joined Swedish hard rock outfit Talisman and recorded 5 albums with them over the next four years before parting with them in 1995, searching for a heavier band. &#197;kesson went on to form the band Southpaw and released an album in 1998, before rejoining Talisman in 2002. 

In 2004, he played with Swedish metal band Tiamat, and in 2005-2006 he served a stint in melodic death metal band Arch Enemy as a substitute for guitarist Christoper Amott. 

In 2007, he rose to heavy metal stardom with Opeth, joining the band for the recording of the album Watershed. To date he has recorded four albums with the band.

Opeth&#39;s sound is a unique blend of death metal elements with a progressive rock expression that is open to eclectic influences ranging from funk, folk or blues to stoner rock, goth, and ambient sounds. 

Not willing to succumb to generic expectations, Opeth has since their 2011 album, Heritage, done away with much of the death metal trademarks in favor of a more progressive rock flavor. 
Since then, they&#39;ve delved even deeper into prog-rock and with 2016&#39;s Sorceress, Opeth is now on their 12th album.

Enjoying international success with Opeth, we&#39;re sure that it won&#39;t be long before &#197;kesson joins the Pantheon of metal gods, he was once inspired by.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[American mixer and producer Tony Maserati is the go-to mixer for the world&#39;s pop royalty, racking up mixing credits by the hundreds.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Let&#39;s, for the fun of it, name a fraction of the artists Maserati has worked with: Beyonce, Notorious B.I.G, James Brown, The Black Eyed Peas, Alicia Keys, Jason Mraz, Nick Jonas, Shawn Mendes and Ariana Grande.

Yeah, few mixers can enjoy that kind of track record.

Maserati cut his engineering teeth in the 1980s at New York&#39;s legendary Sigma Sound Studios before going independent. He initially worked both as an engineer and producer, but soon began specialising in mixing, where he helped define the sound of early New York hip-hop and R&amp;B.

His ever smooth, clear-cut and earworm-inducing mixes have seen him receive countless Grammy nominations and a win to boot, but more importantly - they&#39;ve earned him enormous respect within the industry.

One of the aspects of his tonal intelligence often mentioned by peers and clients, is his ability to compensate for poor or sloppy recordings.

Sometimes you just have to work with what you&#39;re given - and few people can transform unassuming songs into tight, musically powerful  hits that stay true to the intended artistic direction.

But with Maserati behind the console, it&#39;s as good as guaranteed.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[From the local church to professional studio sessions and international touring, Ajay Knight is synonymous with tight and tasteful low end funk. But that&#39;s really not surprising, considering he played with Blackstreet.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Knight played the drums for 13 years, before his mother took him to a show with Gospel star, John P. Kee where fellow TC artist, Maurice Fitzgerald, was holding down the bass for John P. Kee, and his infectious grooves inspired a young Knight to switch out the drums. 

After he talked his mother into buying him a bass guitar, he got to work playing in the local church, learning the instrument by ear and practicing. 

Following years of open-mics and playing different jobs, he landed a gig with legendary producer-songwriter and founding member of Blackstreet, Teddy Riley, and ended up playing bass for Blackstreet. 

His playing is a masterful display in the soulful rhythmic grooves that evoke his gospel upbringings underpinned by a solid powerful touch that fills out the low-end and propels the song forward.

Recently, Knight has been touring Denmark with Danish recording artist Burhan G, bringing his expertise from the new jack swing genre to the cold north through his tight and funky tones.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Danish guitar-virtuoso and local hero, Uffe Steen, is slowly but surely making his presence felt on the internet with his absolutely breathtaking chops and imaginative playing.  ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a lefty, growing up with only a right hand guitar around, Steen wasted no time - he just flipped it and got busy playing upside down. By the time he learned that the strings were supposed to go the other way, he was already neck-deep in developing his own style. This pragmatic approach to the instrument might be part of what makes his playing so unique. 

As a young man, Steen actually studied the clarinet, not the guitar, at the Royal Academy of Music in Denmark. Luckily for us, he chose to devote his attention to the guitar after finishing his studies. Though he sees himself as a musician first, Steen has taught guitar at the Royal Academy since 1982, where he is also an associate professor. He has authored several instructional books for the guitar on blues and jazz playing. 

It&#39;s difficult to describe Steen&#39;s playing style. It has the same feel as when David Gilmour plays, where nothing ever sounds rushed or difficult. His bends are wide and clear with an almost vocal-like phrasing a bit like the great Albert King. Even with those great masters in mind, Steen still doesn&#39;t really sound like anybody else and no one else sounds quite like him - a hallmark of the truly great musicians.

He uses different edges of the pick, picks in different positions along the pickups, and switches from pick to fingers for a plethora of tones. By using his volume and tone controls, he gets a wealth of dynamics and tones from his simple guitar-into-an-amp setup. 

At the same time, Steen keeps impeccable timing, comping away in the background until it&#39;s his time to shine. Sometimes he&#39;ll even make up musical comments to a song on the spot. Like making the guitar cluck like a hen. Not just chicken picking - the actual way a chicken sounds!

With a busy touring schedule, Steen&#39;s approach to playing is that it has to be fun. That&#39;s why he keeps challenging himself by learning new material and new ways to play. His tireless work ethic and will to explore different genres has meant that Steen has evaded the pitfalls of falling into habits and staying in the comfort zone. 

Since he started performing in 1966, he has fronted several jazz ensembles but also served as sideman extraordinaire, lending his skills to different artists in a wide range of genres from folk to jazz and blues. 

With four solo records under his belt and over 70 album appearances since he started recording in the early seventies, Steen is a veteran with a distinguished recording career. His last record, Twangs, from 2011 was an eclectic mix of jazz, country, americana and blues, showcasing his mastery of the guitar and deep knowledge of the genres.

With his online following steadily increasing on his YouTube channel where he regularly uploads original compositions as well as solo interpretations of classic pieces. Here at TC Electronic, we are excited to be working with this local legend.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Originally from Minnesota, Eric Whorton aka. Gearmanndude was raised on 70&#39;s Country Music and AM Radio soft rock, but was eventually drawn to the six string by Eddie Van Halen, and the allure of 80&#39;s hair bands.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Eric spent his high school years playing professionally on the northern Minnesota and Wisconsin club circuit.  

The bright lights called to him and he headed for Nashville at age 18 and spent 6 years touring the United States, France, Germany, England, and The Netherlands in a number of acts, as well as becoming a regular fixture in the Nashville club and studio scene.  

Nashville put him on stages with The Ramones, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Los Lobos, Jimmy Buffett, Colonel Bruce Hampton, Blues Traveler, Dave Matthews, KoKo Taylor, and countless acts on the Blues Festival Circuit.  

Nashville eventually loosened its grip on Eric, and he relocated to Louisville, Kentucky, to form the whiskey-tinged southern rock band EL ROOSTARS with friends met along the Music City journey.  

EL ROOSTARS shared the stage with a who&#39;s who of national acts over a 13 year time-period, including:  Kings of Leon, Shooter Jennings, Kid Rock, Steppenwolf, Dan Baird, Billy Burnette, Molly Hatchett, Joe Ely, Savoy Brown, Todd Snyder and more,  

Most recently, Eric has assembled a number of local tribute acts such as The Uncle Alberts (Paul McCartney/Wings tribute), Vinylicious (multiple tributes), The Tributantes (multiple tributes), and Exile on Elm Street (Rolling Stones Tribute), which eventually landed him the guitar slot in The Bobby Keys Band, (40+ year member of The Rolling Stones, most famous for the sax solo on &#39;Brown Sugar&#39;).  

2015 was his first year as a member of The Barnstable/Brown Kentucky Derby band, where he shares the stage annually with Richie Sambora, Orianthi, Travis Tritt, Kix Brooks, Montgomery Gentry, Kid Rock, Sammy Hagar, Terri Clark, and other celebrities that attend the Derby event.  

He&#39;s in the Barnstable band along with Bob Ramsey and Kimmet Cantwell, which landed him in FROM PARIS, where he now channels the energy and influences of 30+ years of following his guitar wherever it leads him.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Operating out of Ontario, Canada, Glenn Fricker is the face of Spectre Sound Studios YouTube channel. He is an experienced recording engineer with more than 20 years of experience recording hard rock and metal acts professionally. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Like so many other hopeful young boys, Fricker picked up the guitar in his youth with the dream of one day being in Judas Priest. 

He didn&#39;t get the job but kept busy with music, focusing on the recording aspect where he found, he had considerable talent.

When he felt like he was seeing the same recording mistakes being made over and over again by upcoming indie-bands, he launched his YouTube channel, taking matters into his own hands. 

Fricker&#39;s impressive following of over 225k subscribers is a testament to the value of his content. In-depth lessons on recording and mixing, various aspects of recording to be considered and just good sound advice for musicians in the studio.

His channel also features thorough reviews of guitars, pedals, amps, microphones and other recording equipment - all of it done in Fricker&#39;s own unique style.

Nothing if not outspoken, Fricker says what&#39;s on his mind. 

His outspokenness however, is just a product of his great passion for recording and getting the best possible tone. And singers not cupping the damn microphone.

This enthusiasm has landed him in a bit of a feud with a mob of angry bass players among several others. 

We highly recommend some of his rants on the general state of the music business - they&#39;re quite epic!

					<artistBio><![CDATA[After stumbling across the guitar sorceries of Eric Johnson&#39;s Cliffs of Dover and Van Halen&#39;s Eruption at his uncle&#39;s house, Tyler Larson, like so many other young men, was hooked for life.  

]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Based in Asheville, North Carolina, Larson has more than 15 years of experience as a guitar player and is the founder of the rapidly growing multi-platform outlet for all things guitar, Music Is Win

Born in 1989, Larson was a field goal kicker in high school and was originally going to college to study political science on a football scholarship.

Luckily for us, he opted out and ended up at the Berklee School of Music, where he earned a B.M. in guitar performance.

Attending Berklee gave Larson the opportunity to study under a wealth of world class guitarists, taking his guitar skills and knowledge of music to new heights.

At some point during his studies, Larson became aware of the high number of fellow students dropping out because of the demanding schedule of tests and exams. 

He started pondering alternative ways of teaching the complex material and came up with his own teaching system which would become the Guitar Super System.

After earning his degree, Larson got a full-time job and taught guitar on the side until he started Music Is Win in 2015 and since then, he has helped thousands of players with insightful, pedagogical lessons, and honest gear reviews.

Not just a gifted guitar player and teacher, Larson is also a talented content maker and looking at the content he produces, it&#39;s clear to anyone that Larson lives and breathes guitar. 

His keen eye for all the typical experiences and headaches so common to guitarists, that they have become invisible, has become a genre of memes in itself, prompting his site description: &#39;Guitar players will get it.&#39; 

He also posts videos of thought provoking experiments. The kind of experiments that guitar players might sit around and wonder about but never actually go through with. 

What would it sound like if I played through five wah pedals at once? 

Thanks to Music Is Win, the answer is available on YouTube.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Phillip McKnight is a luthier who started building and repairing basses and guitars in 2003. He is known throughout the industry for having a seemingly endless knowledge of instruments, and gear, as well the ins and outs of the music business.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[McKnight has gained an impressive amount of traction online as an opinion maker about guitar gear and guitar related topics. With his clear, straightforward and honest videos about gear, he has struck a chord with guitarists worldwide, reviewing pieces of equipment and offering his opinions on some of the most frequently asked questions about guitar. 

As a former music store owner, his insight on both the tech stuff and the commercial side of things surpasses almost anyone. This inspired him to start a YouTube Channel, Know Your Gear, in 2015, and it quickly became a well-known source for information about gear. 
His videos are filled with easy and simple hacks to improve most instruments, useful and applicable guitar lessons as well as insightful, in-depth discussions on different aspects of the world of guitar.

McKnight has built a community of players who have a shared passion for gear and music. This community is predicated on the idea that the equipment music is made on, in some cases, can be just as important as the music itself, so understanding it is key to the development of a musician. Know Your Gear has now become internationally renowned with tens of millions of views, and over one hundred thousand subscribers and growing.

Here at TC Electronic, we applaud McKnight&#39;s open and thoughtful approach to the guitar industry. This approach was also evident when we did a TonePrint with him at GuitCon this year. Rarely, a player has a vision of what he wants a TonePrint to do, that is so precise and particular as McKnight&#39;s TonePrint is. It&#39;s something that you can use immediately and we know it will inspire a ton of players.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Born in 1966, Philip Xenidis started playing the guitar at the age of five, when his father brought home an electric guitar for him. Barely able to hold the guitar, he kept at it, and today we know him simply as Phil X!]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Inspired by the great guitar heroes like Eddie Van Halen, Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix among others, Phil X set out to become a musician and from 1982 to 1997, Phil X was active in rock acts such as Sidinex, Aldo Nova and Triumph.

After that, he decided to try his luck in Los Angeles where he quickly became a sought after session guitarist, putting his touch on records by artists like Tommy Lee, Alice Cooper, Chris Cornell and Rob Zombie to mention a few.

From the early 2000s to 2010, Phil X also played guitar in the turbo-pop band, Powder, where they were a staple of the club scene in LA. Since 2003, he has also fronted his own power-rock trio, The Drills, singing and handling guitars. So far, the Drills have released three records with a fourth on the way.

In 2008, Phil X was hired by the vintage guitar dealer Fretted Americana, to host demonstrations of their most prized guitars on their YouTube channel. As Phil X poured all of his energy and charisma into the videos, showcasing his amazing abilities, the demonstrations turned into something more, with people tuning in to watch Phil X more than the guitars!

In 2011, he got a call from Jon Bon Jovi, asking him to fill in for Richie Sambora for 13 shows on the Circle tour. A daunting task to say the least but Phil X stepped in and did the job so well that in 2016, he got the gig permanently. 

To anyone familiar with Phil X&#39;s playing, this should come as no surprise. Through melodic phrasing with a well-developed ear for tone, lead lines at blinding speed with aggressive picking and a keen sense of musical tension, Phil X builds up dissonance and energy through dynamics as well as harmony before it culminates in a powerful resolution.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Hailing from Leipzig, Germany, Martin Miller is making a name for himself as a professional musician and an inspiring and knowledgeable guitar teacher. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Growing up around music and guitars, Miller has been playing guitar ever since he was a school boy but got serious about it when he was in his teens.  

In 2010, after attending a conservatory for years, Miller graduated with high marks from the prestigious Carl-Maria-Von-Weber college of music in Dresden, majoring in music education and instrumental rock/pop/jazz. Since 2015, Miller has come back to the school, working as a teacher and giving lectures. 

Miller&#39;s playing has garnered respect from the likes of John Petrucci who has described Miller as a &#39;monster player&#39;. This comes as no surprise once you witness his incredible technique. 

His playing is at once a study in precision mechanics, mastering intricate picking patterns in weird note clusters with effortless fluidity and a display of sheer musicality with an organic and tasteful sense of melody and tension.

Miller&#39;s inspirations are numerable and varied with excursions into progressive metal, jazz, fusion and everything in between. These inspirations are apparent on his solo record &#39;The Other End&#39;. 

Aside from recording, Miller has toured internationally as a solo artist and instructor, teaching masterclasses and providing instructional content online through several channels. His YouTube channel has attracted more than five million views and with a steady following. 

In recent years, Miller has made appearances with Tom Quayle among others and continues to teach and tour, putting his massive chops to good use.

After his friend inspired him to play guitar with a bright colored shred axe, Moracchioli knew he had to become a guitar player. 

He was drawn into the world of Rage Against The Machine, Pantera and Sepultura with their aggressive punchy sound. 

For years he played in different local bands, learning the skillset from the ground up. After he and his wife bought a house, Moracchioli suddenly had the room to build his own home studio. 

However, after going viral with a metal cover of Lady Gaga&#39;s Pokerface that he made just for the fun of it, Moracchioli has devoted most of his time to his YouTube channel. 

He has specialized himself with making infectiously cool sounding metal covers of pop songs and has reached a staggering 400+ million views. 

Aside from his music, Moracchioli also uploads gear reviews, tutorials on making records and other studio-related videos.
With spotless production and sharp videos with a good sense of humor it&#39;s easy to see why his channel is so popular.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Steve aka. PixxyLixx like his popular YouTube channel is a guitar vlogger out of Boston, Massachussets. With his formative years solidly placed in the 80&#39;s, Pixxy&#39;s playing style is heavily influenced by the top shredders of the hair metal era.
]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[As a young boy, Pixxy was inspired by country guitarist Roy Clark blazing skill but it wasn&#39;t until Black Sabbath hit him when he was in his teens, that he really got into guitar. 

In fact, he took it serious enough to attend the prestigious Berklee College of Music between his junior and senior years of high school.

He settled into a white-collar job for years, but it was a thriving online community that started his journey back into music after getting into a new band called Steel Panther with their revitalized tongue-in-cheek version of 80s hair metal.

When they announced a guitar solo contest online, Steve uploaded his contribution onYouTube under the moniker, Pixxylixxx inspired by the artists of the heyday of hair metal. 

Sadly, Pixxy didn&#39;t win the contest but he gained a few followers on YouTube. Using the reach and influence of his channel and other social media, he has transformed over the last several years from a white collar professional to a well-known guitarist with a solid following.  

With over 50k subscribers, Pixxylixxx is regularly uploading videos of his own, doing guest sessions with other YouTubers, and recording his own EP &#39;The United Steak of America&#39;, scheduled for release in early 2018. Furthermore, he provides instructional videos like guitar lessons and in-depth gear reviews.

With his honest, straightforward personality and warm charisma that shows his knowledge and experience it&#39;s no wonder that Pixxylixxx has gathered over 11 million views.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[California-based guitar blogger, Trey Xavier, is the man behind the Gear Gods channel on YouTube, delivering metal-centric content to a horde of virtual metal heads.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Xavier started playing guitar at 12, when he was at summer camp and saw all the other kids playing guitars. From then on, he was hooked and a year later he returned to summer camp triumphantly, having learned the guitar himself. 

After a period of listening to alt-rock and punk, Xavier was turned on to John Petrucci&#39;s playing and knew right away that this was something special. Something he had to be a part of. 

At age 15-16, he started to really take guitar serious and upped his practice regimen drastically which naturally made his skills progress. 

Not long after, he attended the prestigious Berklee College of Music but moved to California eventually to finish his studies at Sonoma State University. 

In addition to being Editor-In-Chief of Gear Gods, Trey fronts progressive metal band In Virtue who are looking forward to releasing new material in 2018.

These days, Xavier spends his time editing Gear Gods, covering gear specifically for the metal audience but also music theory, guitar lessons, and tips on recording and producing metal from professionals.]]></artistBio2>

					<artistBio><![CDATA[British fusion jazz virtuoso, Tom Quayle, is a master of fluid legato improvisation and an accomplished guitar instructor, hosting masterclasses all over the world. 
]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Born in Bristol in 1980, Quayle picked up the guitar at the relatively late age of 15. 

Growing up in a family of musicians however, he was no stranger to the world of music, having listened to his father, an accomplished finger style guitarist, play in folk clubs for years. 

Like most young guys first getting into guitar, he was playing along to Iron Maiden and Metallica.

He devoured any guitar magazine, he could get his hands on, learning the lessons section note for note by himself until he eventually began taking lessons. 

It was his guitar teacher that inspired Quayle to start experimenting with the 4ths tuning that has since become second nature ot him, forming a large part of his sound and style. 

At that time, Quayle was getting heavily into fusion and jazz and chose to pursue music as a way of life.

After graduating from Leeds College of Music in 2002, he spent a few years playing and teaching jazz. But it wasn&#39;t until he heard a Greg Howe recording that he got inspired to play fusion again. 

He found that the 4ths tuning made improvising much easier for him because of the fretboard symmetry it provided and has since developed his entire technique around it. 

Earlier this year, he released the record &#39;Chapter One&#39; with The Elba Triangle, a group consisting of Quayle himself and fellow guitarists Marco Sfogli and Alessandro Benvenuti, doing fresh takes on classic fusion songs and showcasing their guitar wizardry.

Heavily inspired by the late great Allan Holdsworth, his inventive and fluid playing has garnered praise from the likes of Dweezil Zappa, John Petrucci, Greg Howe, and Andy Timmons.

These days, Quayle spends his time touring and teaching, and he has an upcoming release coming out with fellow guitar virtuoso, Martin Miller.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Knowledgeable, honest, and energetic, Henning Pauly aka. EytschPi42, is not just a guitar player, but a skilled producer, composer, and entrepreneur.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Growing up in a musical family, Pauly originally started playing the piano when he was six years old. Though he caught on pretty quick, the piano didn&#39;t really inspire him the way that music should. 

In fact, musical inspiration didn&#39;t really hit him until he turned 15, when his brother bought him the first Bon Jovi album as a birthday present and he started exploring the world of rock &#39;n roll in the heyday of hair metal.

Not long after, Pauly got his first cheap nylon string acoustic. 

At 21, he went to Berklee College of Music in Boston and majored in &#39;Contemporary Writing and Production&#39;, as well as &#39;Music Synthesis&#39; (Sound Design), graduating in 2001 summa cum laude.

After that, he went straight to LA where he briefly worked at the famous Guitar Center on Sunset. 
This led to him finding a position as the head of the studio for an ad agency where he worked for 5 years. 

He wrote jingles, produced radio and TV spots: including the used car dealer spots...

By coincidence, he got a deal with a progressive rock record label which lead to him writing and producing albums with James LaBrie (Dream Theater), Sebastain Bach (Skid Row), Michael Sadler (Saga), Mike Keneally (Vai, Satriani, etc.) and many others. 

After that, Pauly moved back to Germany and built a studio and somehow that led him to making YouTube videos about guitar gear. 

His videos are reviews not demos and always feature a section, where he gives his honest opinion about the gear in question.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[As a solo artist, Spender is not your run of the mill singer-songwriter-strumming-cowboy-chords performer. With her rich voice, passionate singing and jaw-dropping fingerstyle playing, Spender is something else entirely.]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[Based in Bristol, Spender got drawn into playing music, heavily inspired by Muse&#39;s Matt Bellamy but her admiration for John Mayer is perhaps more evident in her own music. 

Spender was raised on Sting, Joni Mitchell and Carole King but has also drawn influence from other solo performers with unique and characteristic playing styles like KT Tunstall and St. Vincent.

Both dynamic and groovy, Spender has opted to forego the guitar pick, using her thumb and fingers for complete control over the strings. Often, she will handle bass lines and harmony at the same time, underscoring them with tasty licks and musical accentuations.

Each of her tasteful compositions display a clear soul and blues influence, delivered with a characteristically sultry voice over a wide vocal range - the result of classical voice training since the age of seven. 

In 2014, Spender released her first EP, Faux Americana, playing all the instruments herself, followed by The Taking Shape EP and Live in Bristol.  Rumor has it that she&#39;s currently working on another one.

On her YouTube channel, Spender posts videos of performances, talks with other musicians, reviews gear, and tons of other cool stuff. 

Aside from recording and doing videos, Spender is planning on touring extensively in the near future but she has already performed all over the UK (e.g. Ronnie Scott&#39;s), the US and Germany.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Based in Brighton, England, a city with a vibrant math-rock scene, Joe Branton was always into progressive, boundary seeking music. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[After witnessing a fellow musician with a lot of pedals, Branton realized that he could stack as many effects on top of each other as he liked, fueling his inspiration for tone searching even more.

This approach is visible in his penchant for the more extreme effect pedals, finding inspiration in trying to push them to their limit and beyond.

In spite of his fascination for complex sounding bands like King Crimson to the Mars Volta, Branton started out his journey as a musician by playing in punk bands but sees several similarities between punk and prog aesthetics as well as the uncompromising attitude to the music. 

Working as a marketing manager for a large music store in Brighton is where Branton and a few colleagues started doing the Guitar Nerds podcast together after hours.

Eventually people found other jobs and the guys decided to continue the podcast independently as it was growing quite popular. 

Aside from working and doing podcasts, Branton also handles bass duties for his progressive math-rock band, Poly-Math, which are working on a double album to be released in 2018.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[From the sunny coast of Southern California, Sean Piece Johnson brings his passion for music and the guitar to the world through his band, Cockeyed Optimist, and his growing YouTube channel. 

]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[A Los Angeles native, Sean grew up in the hotbed of the entertainment industry. This provided a unique environment for his growing interest in show business, but it was always music that pulled at Sean the strongest. 

Growing up, he was exposed to many of the greats; his earliest favorites included The Beatles, Michael Jackson, and Jimi Hendrix, but it wasn&#39;t until he began religiously watching MTV&#39;s TRL that he became exposed to the aggressive tones of late 90&#39;s rock with bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and System of a Down. 

It was this strange combination of influences that finally drove Sean to take up the guitar. Although he didn&#39;t take to the instrument immediately, it was his first onstage experience that cemented Sean&#39;s passion for music.

After high school, Sean enrolled in the Musicians Institute to begin honing his craft. While attending MI, he met his bandmate and partner Cynda Renae and begin writing the music of Cockeyed Optimist.

Sean became aware of a strange phenomenon: his friends began coming to him for advice and tips on guitar equipment. He would also discover YouTube.

In 2013, he began his weekly YouTube demo series &#39;Stompbox Saturday&#39;. The show gave Sean an outlet for his desire to play guitar for an audience and share his knowledge of effects pedals. 

Since then, he has branched out his demo work to include guitars, amplifiers, and recording equipment.

In addition to growing his YouTube channel, Cockeyed Optimist is still going strong. 

Since the band began, they have self-released 2 EPs, filmed several music videos, and played shows across the West Coast of the United State - all without the support of a record label or management. 

You can currently find them in the studio recording their first full-length album.

					<artistBio><![CDATA[Long before YouTube and his coronation as The Tone King, Louis got his first guitar as 6th grader, a white flying V that reminded him of KK Downing&#39;s axe. ]]></artistBio>
					<artistBio2><![CDATA[The Tone King got his first cassette, when he was just a kid. In those days, he went by the name Louis. It was Billy Joel&#39;s Glass Houses and Louis thought it was okay. 

But when his cousin&#39;s girlfriend handed him a copy of M&#246;tley Cr&#252;e&#39;s first album it completely blew him away. This guy was always going to be a metal head.

Being a teenager in the early eighties, witnessing the dawn of metal and the rise of MTV was a glorious time for metal fans.

Naturally, The Tone King spent his youth playing with various local bands, doing talent shows and honing his skill. 

Growing up and getting a real job meant that he could finally afford all the cool gear that he had fantasized about as a kid. 

Before the internet, The Tone King, shared his experiences about gear and music on bulletin boards. So when he got his own website, he continued in that vein. 

When he started posting videos on YouTube however, there was no turning back - The Tone King was born. 

And the rest, as they say, is history. 

His YouTube channel now caters to over 80k subscribers with a wide variety of content from gear reviews, comments and thoughts on the music industry to artist interviews.]]></artistBio2>
